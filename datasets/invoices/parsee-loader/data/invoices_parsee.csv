The fragments start with a number and then the actual text. The lower the number of the fragment, the earlier the fragment appeared in the document (reading from left to right, top to bottom). Please respond as concise as possible. 


                    The question is: What is the invoice total?  possible values: any number (positive or negative, including decimals)
 We also want to retrieve some meta information. In the following we will present the meta item ID and then the additional question to be answered, format: (META_ID): QUESTION. In the answer please first provide the meta ID (for the main question use 'main question' instead) in brackets and then the answer. If there are several possible answers to the question (with different meta values), structure your answer into multiple answer blocks of the same format, one after the other separated by new lines.
(meta0): What is the currency?  possible values (separated by $ symbols): $ USD $, $ EUR $, $ Other $
(meta1): What is the VAT included in the total?  possible values: any percentage value 

                    
                    Please at the end of each answer also provide the numbers of the text fragments you used to answer in square brackets. 


                    One possible answer block could be (there can be more than one in your response): (main question): 123
(meta0): $ USD $
(meta1): 19%
