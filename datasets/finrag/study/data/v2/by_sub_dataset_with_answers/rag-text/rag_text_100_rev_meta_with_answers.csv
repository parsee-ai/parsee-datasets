[470]: Net Earnings [/470]
[471]: We reported net earnings of $6.9 billion ($27.55 per share) in 2023 and $5.7 billion ($21.66 per share) in 2022. Net earnings and earnings per share in 2023 were affected by the factors mentioned above. Earnings per share also benefited from a net decrease of approximately 13.4 million weighted average common shares outstanding in 2023, compared to 2022. The reduction in weighted average common shares was a result of share repurchases, partially offset by share issuance under our stock-based awards and certain defined contribution plans. [/471]
[472]: Business Segment Results of Operations [/472]
[473]: We operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, MFC, RMS and Space. We organize our business segments based on the nature of products and services offered. [/473]
[474]: Net sales and operating profit of our business segments exclude intersegment sales, cost of sales and profit as these activities are eliminated in consolidation and thus are not included in management’s evaluation of performance of each segment. Business segment operating profit includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees as the operating activities of the equity method investees are closely aligned with the operations of our business segments.

[421]: Consolidated Results of Operations [/421]
[422]: Our operating cycle is primarily long-term and involves many types of contracts for the design, development and manufacture of products and related activities with varying delivery schedules. Consequently, the results of operations of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of sales and profits, may not be indicative of future operating results. The following discussions of comparative results should be reviewed in this context. All per share amounts cited in these discussions are presented on a “per diluted share” basis, unless otherwise noted. Our consolidated results of operations were as follows (in millions, except per share data): [/422]
[424]: Certain amounts reported in other income (expense), net, including our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees, are included in the operating profit of our business segments. Accordingly, such amounts are included in the discussion of our business segment results of operations.

[267]: For more information on how these factors could impact earnings, financial position, cash flow and stockholders’ equity, see “Critical Accounting Policies - Postretirement Benefit Plans” in the MD&A and “Note 11 – Postretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. [/267]
[268]: Our estimates and projections may prove to be inaccurate and certain of our assets may be at risk of future impairment. [/268]
[269]: The accounting for some of our most significant activities is based on judgments and estimates, which are complex and subject to many variables. For example, accounting for sales using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method requires that we assess risks and make assumptions regarding future schedule, cost, technical and performance issues for thousands of contracts, many of which are long-term in nature. This process can be especially difficult when estimating costs for development programs because of the inherent uncertainty in developing a new product or technology. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes involved in accounting for our contracts, materially different amounts or revenue and operating profit could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, we initially allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses based on a preliminary assessment of the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For significant acquisitions we may use a one-year measurement period to analyze and assess several factors used in establishing the asset and liability fair values as of the acquisition date which could result in adjustments to asset and liability balances.

 (row end);
 (row 3) 
 (col 0): Description of the Matter (col 1): For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Corporation recorded net sales of $67.6 billion. As more fully described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation generates the majority of its net sales from long-term contracts with its customers whereby substantially all of the Corporation’s revenue is recognized over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress. Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress, the Corporation measures progress towards completion based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the estimated total costs to complete the performance obligation (s) (referred to as the estimate-at-completion analysis). The Corporation estimates profit on these contracts as the difference between total estimated revenues and total estimated cost at completion. The percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to estimate contract sales and costs associated with its contracts with customers. At the outset of a long-term contract, the Corporation identifies risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract. Throughout the contract life cycle, the Corporation monitors and assesses the effects of those risks on its estimates of sales and total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if the Corporation successfully retires risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which would decrease the estimated total costs to complete the contract. Conversely, the profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase. Changes to the profit booking rates resulting from changes in estimates could have a material effect on the Corporation’s results of operations. Auditing the Corporation’s estimate-at-completion analyses used in its revenue recognition process was complex due to the judgment involved in evaluating the significant estimates and assumptions made by management in the initial development and subsequent updates to the Corporation’s estimate-at-completion analyses. The estimate-at-completion analyses of each contract consider risks surrounding the Corporation’s ability to achieve the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract. (row end);
 (row 4) 
 (row end);
 (row 5) 
 (col 0): How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit (col 1): We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of relevant internal controls over the Corporation’s revenue recognition process. For example, we tested internal controls over management’s review of the estimate-at-completion analyses and the significant assumptions underlying the estimated contract value and estimated total costs to complete. We also tested internal controls that management executes which are designed to validate the data used in the estimate-at-completion analyses was complete and accurate. To test the accuracy of the Corporation’s estimate-at-completion analyses, our audit procedures included, among others, comparing estimates of labor costs, subcontractor costs, and materials to historical results of similar contracts, and agreeing the key terms to contract documentation and management’s estimates. We also performed sensitivity analyses over the significant assumptions to evaluate the change in the profit booking rates resulting from changes in the assumptions. (row end);

As explained in Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation remeasures the qualified defined benefit pension assets and obligations at the end of each year or more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events. The amounts are measured using actuarial valuations, which depend on key assumptions such as the discount rate. Auditing the defined benefit pension obligation was complex and required the involvement of specialists as a result of the judgmental nature of the actuarial assumptions such as the discount rate used in the measurement process. The discount rate assumption has a significant effect on the measurement of the projected benefit obligation. (row end);

[593]: Contract Accounting / Sales Recognition [/593]
[594]: The majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the U.S. Government and international customers (including FMS contracted through the U.S. Government) for the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. Substantially all of our revenue is recognized over time as we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfers continuously to the customer. For performance obligations to deliver products with continuous control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage of completion cost-to-cost measure of progress. [/594]

[496]: Our net sales are primarily derived from long-term contracts for products and services provided to the U.S. Government as well as FMS contracted through the U.S. Government. We recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. For performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts. For performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied. [/496]
[759]: Selected Financial Data by Business Segment [/759]
[760]: Net sales and operating profit of our business segments exclude intersegment sales, cost of sales and profit as these activities are eliminated in consolidation and thus are not included in management’s evaluation of performance of each segment. Business segment operating profit includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees as the operating activities of the equity method investees are closely aligned with the operations of our business segments.

[810]: The accounting policies for our segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in note 2. Certain corporate costs, including those related to selling, finance, legal, risk management, human resources, corporate management and information technology systems, are deemed to be of an operating nature and are allocated to our segments based primarily on rental fleet size.

[820]: (1) Reflects transaction costs associated with the General Finance acquisition that was completed in May 2021. Merger related costs only include costs associated with major acquisitions that significantly impact our operations. [/820]
[751]: Nature of goods and services [/751]
[752]: In the following table, revenue is summarized by type and by the applicable accounting standard. [/752]
[754]: Revenues by reportable segment and geographical market are presented in note 5 of the consolidated financial statements using the revenue captions reflected in our consolidated statements of operations. The majority of our revenue is recognized in our general rentals segment and in the U.S. (for the year ended December 31, 2023, 75 percent and 91 percent, respectively). We believe that the disaggregation of our revenue from contracts to customers as reflected above, coupled with the further discussion below and the reportable segment and geographical market disclosures in note 5, depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. [/754]
[755]: Lease revenues (Topic 842) The accounting for the types of revenue that are accounted for under Topic 842 is discussed below. Owned equipment rentals represent our most significant revenue type (they accounted for 69 percent of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023) and are governed by our standard rental contract. We account for such rentals as operating leases. The lease terms are included in our contracts, and the determination of whether our contracts contain leases generally does not require significant assumptions or judgments. Our lease revenues do not include material amounts of variable payments. Owned equipment rentals: Owned equipment rentals represent revenues from renting equipment that we own. We do not generally provide an option for the lessee to purchase the rented equipment at the end of the lease, and do not generate material revenue from sales of equipment under such options. We recognize revenues from renting equipment on a straight-line basis. Our rental contract periods are hourly, daily, weekly or monthly. By way of example, if a customer were to rent a piece of equipment and the daily, weekly and monthly rental rates for that particular piece were (in actual dollars) $100, $300 and $900, respectively, we would recognize revenue of $32.14 per day. The daily rate for recognition purposes is calculated by dividing the monthly rate of $900 by the monthly term [/755]
[785]: It is not practicable to reasonably estimate the amounts of revenue and earnings of Ahern Rentals since the acquisition date, primarily due to the movement of fleet between URI locations and the acquired Ahern Rentals locations, as well as our corporate structure and the allocation of corporate costs.

[786]: Pro forma financial information [/786]
[787]: The pro forma information below gives effect to the Ahern Rentals acquisition as if it had been completed on January 1, 2021. The pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of our results had the acquisition been completed on the above date, nor is it necessarily indicative of our future results. The pro forma information reflects Ahern Rentals’ historic revenue presented in accordance with our revenue mapping, does not reflect any cost savings from operating efficiencies or synergies that could result from the acquisition, and also does not reflect additional revenue opportunities following the acquisition. The table below presents unaudited pro forma consolidated income statement information as if Ahern Rentals had been included in our consolidated results for the entire period reflected: [/787]

[555]: Business Projections - We make assumptions about the level of equipment rental activity in the marketplace and cost levels. These assumptions drive our planning assumptions for pricing and utilization and also represent key inputs for developing our cash flow projections. These projections are developed using our internal business plans over a ten-year planning period that are updated at least annually; [/555]
[556]: Long-term Growth Rates - Beyond the planning period, we also utilize an assumed long-term growth rate representing the expected rate at which a reporting unit's cash flow stream is projected to grow. These rates are used to calculate the terminal value of our reporting units, and are added to the cash flows projected during our ten-year planning period; and [/556]
[557]: Discount Rates - Each reporting unit's estimated future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted-average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by market participants. The weighted-average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise. [/557]
[1006]: Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting [/1006]
[1007]: The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a–15(f) and 15d–15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. [/1007]

[982]: (4) This reflects the amortization of the intangible assets acquired in the major acquisitions that significantly impact our operations (the ""major acquisitions,"" each of which had annual revenues of over $ 200 prior to acquisition). The increases in 2023 primarily reflect the impact of the Ahern Rentals acquisition. [/982]
[983]: (5) This reflects the impact of extending the useful lives of equipment acquired in certain major acquisitions, net of the impact of additional depreciation associated with the fair value mark-up of such equipment. The increases in 2023 primarily reflect the impact of the Ahern Rentals acquisition. [/983]
[984]: (6) This reflects additional costs recorded in cost of rental equipment sales associated with the fair value mark-up of rental equipment acquired in certain major acquisitions that was subsequently sold. The increases in 2023 primarily reflect the impact of the Ahern Rentals acquisition. [/984]

[519]: (4) This reflects additional costs recorded in cost of rental equipment sales associated with the fair value mark-up of rental equipment acquired in certain major acquisitions that was subsequently sold. The increase in 2023 primarily reflects the impact of the Ahern Rentals acquisition. [/519]
[520]: (5) This primarily reflects the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchase price of the redeemed notes. For additional information, see ""Results of Operations-Other costs/(income)-Interest expense, net"" below. [/520]
[521]: For the year ended December 31, 2023, net income increased $319, or 15.2 percent, and net income margin decreased 120 basis points to 16.9 percent. For the year ended December 31, 2023, adjusted EBITDA increased $1.239 billion, or 22.1 percent, and adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 50 basis points to 47.8 percent. [/521]
[522]: The year-over-year decrease in net income margin primarily reflects the impact of the Ahern Rentals acquisition on gross margins from equipment rentals and sales of rental equipment, increased restructuring charges associated with the Ahern Rentals acquisition, and increased interest expense, partially offset by reductions in selling, general and administrative (""SG&A"") and income tax expenses as a percentage of revenue. Depreciation and repairs and maintenance expenses for the rental equipment acquired in the Ahern Rentals acquisition were higher than for our other rental equipment, which negatively impacted equipment rentals gross margin year-over-year. In addition to the impact of the Ahern Rentals acquisition, the decreased gross margin from sales of rental equipment reflects the normalization of the used equipment market and the expanded use of wholesale channels. Net interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 included debt redemption losses of $17. Excluding the impact of these losses, interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by [/522]

[749]: Table of Contents [/749]
[750]: We recognize revenue in accordance with two different accounting standards: 1) Topic 606 (which addresses revenue from contracts with customers) and 2) Topic 842 (which addresses lease revenue). Under Topic 606, revenue from contracts with customers is measured based on the consideration specified in the contract with the customer, and excludes any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer, and is the unit of account under Topic 606. As reflected below, most of our revenue is accounted for under Topic 842. Our contracts with customers generally do not include multiple performance obligations. We recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for such products or services. [/750]

[707]: The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit and risk committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

[708]: Revenue Recognition - Cost and Revenue Estimates for Development Contracts - Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements [/708]
[709]: Critical Audit Matter Description [/709]
[710]: As more fully described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company recognizes substantially all revenue as control is transferred to the customer on their long-term contracts over time using the cost-to-cost method (cost incurred relative to total cost estimated at completion). Use of the cost-to-cost-method requires the Company to make reasonably dependable estimates regarding the revenue and costs associated with the design, manufacture and delivery of their products or services. The Company estimates profit on these contracts as the difference between total estimated sales and total estimated costs at completion and recognizes that profit as costs are incurred. Cost [/710]

[701]: We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Northrop Grumman Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

[1141]: Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity [/1141]
[488]: CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS [/488]
[489]: For purposes of the operating results discussion below, we assess our performance using certain financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP” or “FAS”). [/489]
[490]: Mark-to-market adjusted net earnings (MTM-adjusted net earnings) and MTM-adjusted earnings per share (MTM-adjusted EPS) exclude MTM pension and OPB (expense)/benefit and related tax impacts, which are generally only recognized during the fourth quarter. Transaction-adjusted net earnings and transaction-adjusted earnings per share (transaction-adjusted EPS) exclude the MTM impacts noted above, as well as impacts related to the IT services divestiture, including the gain on sale of the business, associated federal and state income tax expenses, transaction costs, and the make-whole premium for early debt redemption. These non-GAAP measures may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as supplemental measures in evaluating the company’s underlying financial performance by presenting the company’s operating results before the non-operational impact of pension and OPB actuarial gains and losses, and with regard to transaction-adjusted net earnings and EPS, the impact of certain divestiture activity. These measures are also consistent with how management views the underlying performance of the business as the impact of MTM accounting and the IT services divestiture are not considered in management’s assessment of the company’s operating performance or in its determination of incentive compensation awards. [/490]
[793]: The amount of revenue recognized for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 that was included in the contract liability balance at the beginning of each year was $ 3.1 billion, $ 2.4 billion and $ 2.0 billion, respectively. [/793]
[794]: Disaggregation of Revenue [/794]
[795]: See Note 16 for information regarding the company’s sales by customer type, contract type and geographic region for each of our segments. We believe those categories best depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. [/795]
[796]: General and Administrative Expenses In accordance with applicable FAR and CAS requirements, most general management and corporate expenses incurred at the segment and corporate locations are considered allowable and allocable costs to our U.S. government contracts. Allowable and allocable G&A costs, including independent research and development (IR&D) and bid and proposal (B&P) costs, are allocated on a systematic basis to contracts in progress and are included as a component of total estimated contract costs. [/796]
[491]: We reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures below. These non-GAAP measures may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with GAAP.

[494]: Selected financial highlights are presented in the table below: [/494]
[496]: Sales [/496]
[497]: 2023 sales increased $2.7 billion, or 7 percent, due to higher sales at all four sectors. 2023 sales reflect continued strong demand for our products and services. [/497]
[498]: See “Segment Operating Results” below for further information by segment and “Product and Service Analysis” for product and service detail. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company’s sales by customer type, contract type and geographic region for each of our segments. [/498]
[499]: Operating Income and Margin Rate [/499]
[500]: 2023 operating income decreased $1.1 billion, or 30 percent, primarily due to a $1.56 billion charge on the B-21 program at Aeronautics Systems, partially offset by higher operating income at Space Systems and Defense Systems. The B-21 charge relates to the low-rate initial production (LRIP) phase of the program and is due principally to a change in our assumptions regarding funding to mitigate the impact of macroeconomic disruptions on the program and higher projected manufacturing costs that reflect recent supplier negotiations and our experience in completing the first aircraft. The decrease was also offset by $311 million of lower unallocated corporate expense, largely due to higher deferred state tax benefits associated with the MTM adjustment and B-21 charge and lower intangible asset amortization and PP&E step-up depreciation, as well as a $118 million reduction in the FAS/CAS operating adjustment. 2023 operating margin rate declined to 6.5 percent from 9.8 percent reflecting the items above.

Such intercompany operating income is eliminated in consolidation , so that the company’s total sales and total operating income reflect only those transactions with external customers.

[526]: Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates [/526]
[527]: Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. These items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences could be material. [/527]
[694]: The principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to subscription revenue recognition for customer contracts with multiple performance obligations is a critical audit matter is the matter involved significant audit effort in performing procedures related to management’s identification of distinct performance obligations. [/694]
[695]: Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls over the identification of performance obligations and evaluation of the terms and conditions within the customer contracts for appropriate revenue recognition. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for identifying distinct performance obligations and evaluating the terms and conditions within the customer contracts by examining the customer contracts on a test basis for appropriate revenue recognition.

[559]: Cost of Revenues [/559]
[560]: Cost of subscription revenues . Cost of subscription revenues consists primarily of expenses related to hosting our services and providing support to our customers. These expenses are comprised of data center capacity costs, which include colocation costs associated with our data centers as well as interconnectivity between data centers, depreciation related to our infrastructure hardware equipment dedicated for customer use, amortization of intangible assets, expenses associated with software, public cloud service costs, IT services and dedicated customer support, personnel-related costs directly associated with data center operations and customer support, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation and allocated overhead. [/560]
[561]: Cost of professional services and other revenues . Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of personnel-related costs directly associated with our professional services and training departments, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, the costs of contracted third-party partners, travel expenses and allocated overhead. [/561]
[581]: Our digital workflow products include most of our product offerings and are generally priced on a per user basis. Our remaining product offerings, primarily comprised of our IT Operations Management (“ITOM”) products are predominantly priced on a subscription unit basis. [/581]
[582]: Professional services and other revenues decreased by $63 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the prior year, due to a decrease in services and trainings provided to new and existing customers as we focused on deploying our internal professional services organization as a strategic resource and worked with our partner ecosystem to contract directly with customers for implementation services delivery. [/582]
[583]: We expect professional services and other revenues for the year ending December 31, 2024 to increase in absolute dollars and to remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 as we continue to execute our professional services strategy. [/583]

[692]: Subscription revenue recognition - customer contracts with multiple performance obligations [/692]
[693]: As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company enters into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Subscription revenues include self-hosted offerings in which customers deploy, or the Company grants customers the option to deploy without significant penalty, the Company’s subscription services internally or contract with a third party to host the software. For these contracts, management accounts for the software element separately from the related support and updates as they are distinct performance obligations. The transaction price allocated to the software element is recognized when transfer of control of the software to the customer is complete. The transaction price allocated to the related support and updates are recognized ratably over the contract term. As disclosed by management, evaluating the terms and conditions included within the Company’s customer contracts for appropriate revenue recognition and determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. The Company recognized subscription revenues of $8.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. [/693]

Amortization expenses associated with deferred commissions increased by $99 million, compared to the prior year, due to an increase in contracts with new customers, expansion and renewal contracts. Other sales and marketing program expenses, which include branding, costs associated with purchasing advertising, marketing events and market data, increased by $44 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased program costs and travel for our annual Sales Kickoff.

Recording upward and downward adjustments to the carrying value of our non-marketable equity investments requires quantitative assessments of the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments using various valuation methodologies and involves the use of estimates. The timing and amount of observable price changes are influenced by market dynamics that can impact the valuation of our non-marketable equity investments. These changes could be material based on market conditions and events.

Some of our professional services arrangements are on a fixed fee. Professional services revenues are recognized as services are delivered. Other revenues primarily consist of fees from customer training delivered on-site or through publicly available classes. Typical payment terms require our customers to pay us within 30 days of invoice. [/554]

[947]: Table of Contents [/947]
[950]: (1) Segment income represents operating results of the reportable segments excluding gain and loss on sale of assets, real estate insurance recoveries and losses, impairment charges and provision for income taxes. Included in segment income for Standard Bearer are expenses for intercompany management fees between Standard Bearer and the Service Center and intercompany interest expense. Segment income is reconciled to the Consolidated Statement of Income in Note 8, Business Segments in Notes to Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. [/950]
[951]: (2) Standard Bearer segment income includes rental revenue and expenses from our independent subsidiaries. [/951]
[952]: (3) EBITDA includes litigation related to specific proceedings arising outside of the ordinary course of business as discussed in Item 3. Legal Proceedings. [/952]
[930]: Depreciation and Amortization — Property and equipment are recorded at their original historical cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets. The following is a summary of the depreciable lives of our depreciable assets: [/930]
[932]: Critical Accounting Estimates [/932]
[933]: Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We believe that the application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations, require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. [/933]
[1282]: The Company’s reportable segments are significant operating segments that offer differentiated services. The Company's CODM reviews financial information for each operating segment to evaluate performance and allocate capital resources. This structure reflects its current operational and financial management and provides the best structure to maximize the quality of care and investment strategy provided, while maintaining financial discipline. The Company's CODM does not review assets by segment in his resource allocation and therefore assets by segment are not disclosed below. [/1282]
[1283]: The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . Intercompany revenue is eliminated in consolidation, along with corresponding intercompany expenses. Segment income and loss is defined as profit or loss from operations before provision for income taxes, excluding gain or loss from sale of real estate, real estate insurance recoveries and losses and impairment charges from operations. Included in segment income for Standard Bearer is expense for intercompany services provided by the Service Center as described in Note 6, Standard Bearer , as it is part of the CODM financial information.

[1200]: 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES [/1200]
[1201]: Basis of Presentation — The accompanying consolidated financial statements (the Financial Statements) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The Company is the sole member or stockholder of various consolidated limited liability companies and corporations established to operate various acquired skilled nursing operations, senior living operations and related ancillary services. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company presents noncontrolling interests within the equity section of its consolidated balance sheets and the amount of consolidated net income that is attributable to The Ensign Group, Inc. and the noncontrolling interests in its consolidated statements of income. The Financial Statements include the accounts of all independent subsidiaries controlled by the Company through its ownership of a majority voting interest. Reclassifications — Certain amounts in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation of the current period financial statements. Estimates and Assumptions — The preparation of the Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. The most significant estimates in the Company’s Financial Statements relate to revenue, acquired property and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill, right-of-use assets, impairment of long-lived assets, lease liabilities, general and professional liabilities, workers' compensation and healthcare claims included in accrued self-insurance liabilities and income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. [/1201]
[956]: We believe the presentation of certain Non-GAAP Financial Measures are useful to investors and other external users of our financial statements regarding our results of operations because: [/956]
[957]: • they are widely used by investors and analysts in our industry as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall performance of companies in our industry without regard to items such as other income (expense), net and depreciation and amortization, which can vary substantially from company to company depending on the book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired; and [/957]
[958]: • they help investors evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure and asset base from our operating results. [/958]
[959]: We use the Non-GAAP Financial Measures: [/959]
[960]: • as measurements of our operating performance to assist us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis; [/960]
[961]: • to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of our business; [/961]
[948]: Table element - Text before table: The following table sets forth details of operating results for our revenue, expenses and earnings, and their respective components, as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated:

[966]: We use certain Non-GAAP Financial Measures to compare the operating performance of each operation. These measures are useful in this regard because they do not include such costs as other expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, which may vary from period-to-period depending upon various factors, including the method used to finance operations, the amount of debt that we have incurred, whether an operation is owned or leased, the date of acquisition of a facility or business, and the tax law of the state in which a business unit operates.

[968]: Despite the importance of these measures in analyzing our underlying business, designing incentive compensation and for our goal setting, the Non-GAAP Financial Measures have no standardized meaning defined by GAAP. Therefore, certain of our Non-GAAP Financial Measures have limitations as analytical tools, and they should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported in accordance with GAAP.

[1007]: Table element - Text before table: The adjustments made and previously described in the computation of Adjusted EBITDA are also made when computing Adjusted EBITDAR. We calculate Adjusted EBITDAR by excluding rent-cost of services from Adjusted EBITDA.
We believe the use of Adjusted EBITDAR allows the investor to compare operational results of companies who have operating and capital leases. A significant portion of capital lease expenditures are recorded in interest, whereas operating lease expenditures are recorded in rent expense.

[152]: The segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023, were up $1.5 billion (9%) compared to the previous year.

[153]: Revenues increased $1.2 billion (7%) organically, primarily due to an increase in Gas Power equipment from higher price and scope on Heavy-Duty Gas Turbines and scope on Aeroderivatives, increases in Gas Power and Steam services and increases in Power Conversion services and equipment, partially offset by a reduction in Steam Power equipment due to the ongoing exit of new build coal.

Excluding the results from our run-off Insurance operations, non-operating benefit costs, gains (losses) on purchases and sales of business interests, gains (losses) on equity securities, restructuring costs, separation costs and Russia and Ukraine charges, Adjusted earnings per share* was $2.81. For the year ended December 31, 2023, profit margin was 15.0% and profit was up $11.0 billion, primarily due to an increase in gains on retained and sold ownership interests of $5.7 billion, an increase in segment profit of $2.4 billion, an increase in non-operating benefit income of $1.2 billion, the nonrecurrence of the Steam asset sale impairment of $0.8 billion, the nonrecurrence of debt extinguishment costs of $0.5 billion, a decrease in interest and other financial charges of $0.3 billion, a decrease in Adjusted total corporate operating costs* of $0.1 billion, a decrease in restructuring costs of $0.1 billion and an increase in Insurance profit of $0.1 billion. These increases were partially offset by an increase in separation costs of $0.3 billion. Adjusted organic profit* increased $2.6 billion, driven primarily by increases at all segments and lower Adjusted total corporate operating costs*. [/79]

[152]: For the year ended December 31, 2023, segment revenues were up $1.5 billion (9%) and segment profit was up $0.2 billion (19%). [/152]
[153]: Revenues increased $1.2 billion (7%) organically*, primarily due to an increase in Gas Power equipment from higher price and scope on Heavy-Duty Gas Turbines and scope on Aeroderivatives, increases in Gas Power and Steam services and increases in Power Conversion services and equipment, partially offset by a reduction in Steam Power equipment due to the ongoing exit of new build coal. [/153]
[154]: Profit increased $0.1 billion (10%) organically* primarily due to an increase in Gas Power services volume, price and productivity offsetting inflation. [/154]
[155]: CORPORATE. The Corporate amounts related to revenues and earnings include the results of disposed businesses, certain amounts not included in operating segment results because they are excluded from measurement of their operating performance for internal and external purposes and the elimination of intersegment activities. In addition, the Corporate amounts related to earnings include certain costs of our principal retirement plans, significant, higher-cost restructuring programs, separation costs, and other costs reported in Corporate.

[279]: Table element - Text before table: NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. In November of 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued  ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures . The amendments are intended to increase reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The ASU is effective on a retrospective basis for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on the disclosures within our consolidated financial statements.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures . The amendments require disclosure of specific categories in the rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold and further disaggregation of income taxes paid for individually significant jurisdictions. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on the disclosures within our consolidated financial statements.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. We believe that presenting non-GAAP financial measures provides management and investors useful measures to evaluate performance and trends of the total company and its businesses. This includes adjustments in recent periods to GAAP financial measures to increase period-to-period comparability following actions to strengthen our overall financial position and how we manage our business. In addition, management recognizes that certain non-GAAP terms may be interpreted differently by other companies under different circumstances. In various sections of this report we have made reference to the following non-GAAP financial measures in describing our (1) revenues, specifically organic revenues by segment; organic revenues; and equipment and services organic revenues and (2) profit, specifically organic profit and profit margin by segment; Adjusted profit and profit margin; Adjusted organic profit and profit margin; Adjusted earnings (loss); Adjusted income tax rate; and Adjusted earnings (loss) per share (EPS). The reasons we use these non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures follow.; table: (row 0)

[549]: The Company’s two business lines are organized into three reportable segments. The U.S. pawn segment consists of pawn operations in the U.S., while the Latin America pawn segment consists of pawn operations in Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia and El Salvador. The retail POS payment solutions segment consists of the operations of AFF in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. Financial information regarding the Company’s revenue and long-lived assets by geographic area is provided in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. [/549]
[550]: Critical Accounting Estimates [/550]
[551]: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, related revenue and expenses, and disclosure of gain and loss contingencies at the date of the financial statements. Such estimates, assumptions and judgments are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially from the Company’s estimates. [/551]
[574]: The Company’s other material, indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of certain trade names and pawn licenses. The Company performs its indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment annually as of December 31, and between annual assessments if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying amount. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. [/574]

The Company paid debt issuance costs of $0.3 million during 2023 compared to $1.8 million during 2022. The Company funded $114.4 million for share repurchases and paid dividends of $61.9 million during 2023, compared to funding $157.9 million of share repurchases and dividends paid of $59.6 million during 2022. In addition, the Company paid withholding taxes on net share settlements of restricted stock awards during 2023 of $2.5 million. [/727]
[728]: Non-GAAP Financial Information [/728]
[729]: The Company uses certain financial calculations such as adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, adjusted free cash flow, adjusted retail POS payment solutions segment metrics and constant currency results as factors in the measurement and evaluation of the Company’s operating performance and period-over-period growth. The Company derives these financial calculations on the basis of methodologies other than GAAP, primarily by excluding from a comparable GAAP measure certain items the Company does not consider to be representative of its actual operating performance. These financial calculations are “non-GAAP financial measures” as defined under the SEC rules. The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures in operating its business because management believes they are less susceptible to variances in actual operating performance that can result from the excluded items, other infrequent charges and currency fluctuations. The Company presents these financial measures to investors because management believes they are useful to investors in evaluating the primary factors that drive the Company’s core operating performance and provide greater transparency into the Company’s results of operations. However, items that are excluded and other adjustments and assumptions that are made in calculating these non-GAAP financial measures are significant components in understanding and assessing the Company’s financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should be evaluated in conjunction with, and are not a substitute for, the Company’s GAAP financial measures. Further, because these non-GAAP financial measures are not determined in accordance with GAAP, and are thus susceptible to varying calculations, the non-GAAP financial measures, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly-titled measures of other companies. [/729]
[756]: Free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow are commonly used by investors as additional measures of cash, generated by business operations, that may be used to repay scheduled debt maturities and debt service or, following payment of such debt obligations and other non-discretionary items, that may be available to invest in future growth through new business development activities or acquisitions, repurchase stock, pay cash dividends or repay debt obligations prior to their maturities. These metrics can also be used to evaluate the Company’s ability to generate cash flow from business operations and the impact that this cash flow has on the Company’s liquidity. However, free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for cash flow from operating activities or other income statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table reconciles cash flow from operating activities to free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow (unaudited, in thousands): [/756]
[730]: While acquisitions are an important part of the Company’s overall strategy, the Company has adjusted the applicable financial calculations to exclude merger and acquisition expenses, including the Company’s transaction expenses incurred in connection with its acquisition of AFF and the impacts of purchase accounting with respect to the AFF Acquisition, in order to allow more accurate comparisons of the financial results to prior periods. In addition, the Company does not consider these merger and acquisition expenses to be related to the organic operations of the acquired businesses or its continuing operations, and such expenses are generally not relevant to assessing or estimating the long-term performance of the acquired businesses. Merger and acquisition expenses include incremental costs directly associated with merger and acquisition activities, including professional fees, legal expenses, severance, retention and other employee-related costs, contract breakage costs and costs related to the consolidation of technology systems and corporate facilities"

[795]: The following table presents our revenue disaggregated by primary geographical market and category: [/795]
[797]: (1) No single country included in the other countries category generated more than 10% of total net revenues. [/797]
[798]: (2) Total net revenues include $ 1.8 billion, $ 1.3 billion, and $ 425 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, which do not represent revenues recognized in the scope of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from contracts with customers. Such revenues relate to interest and fees earned on loans and interest receivable, including loans and interest receivable held for sale, as well as hedging gains or losses, and interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances. [/798]
[799]: Net revenues are attributed to the country in which the party paying our fee is located. [/799]
[800]: NOTE 3— NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE [/800]
[801]: Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive common stock outstanding for the period. The dilutive effect of outstanding equity incentive awards is reflected in diluted net income (loss) per share by application of the treasury stock method. The calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share excludes all anti-dilutive common shares. During periods when we report net loss, diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share because the effects of potentially dilutive items would decrease the net loss per share. [/801]
[431]: • Revenues from other value added services: Net revenues derived primarily from revenue earned through partnerships, referral fees, subscription fees, gateway fees, and other services we provide to our merchants and consumers. We also earn revenues from interest and fees earned on our portfolio of loans receivable, and interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances. [/431]
[432]: Our revenues can be significantly impacted by a number of factors, including the following: [/432]
[433]: • The mix of merchants, products, and services; [/433]
[434]: • The mix between domestic and cross-border transactions; [/434]
[435]: • The geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs; and [/435]

[794]: We determine operating segments based on how our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) manages the business, makes operating decisions around the allocation of resources, and evaluates operating performance. Our CODM is our Chief Executive Officer, who regularly reviews our operating results on a consolidated basis. We operate as one segment and have one reportable segment. Based on the information provided to and reviewed by our CODM, we believe that the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows and how they are affected by economic factors are most appropriately depicted through our primary geographical markets and types of revenue categories (transaction revenues and revenues from other value added services). Revenues recorded within these categories are earned from similar products and services for which the nature of associated fees and the related revenue recognition models are substantially similar.

[400]: ** Not meaningful. [/400]
[401]: Net revenues increased $2.3 billion, or 8%, in 2023 compared to 2022 driven primarily by growth in total payment volume (“TPV”, as defined below under “Key Metrics”) of 13%. [/401]
[402]: Total operating expenses increased $1.1 billion, or 4%, in 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to an increase in transaction expense, partially offset by reductions in sales and marketing expense, restructuring and other, and technology and development expense. [/402]
[403]: Operating income increased $1.2 billion, or 31%, in 2023 compared to 2022 due to net revenues growing more than operating expenses. Our operating margin was 17% and 14% in 2023 and 2022, respectively, reflecting the positive impact of operating efficiencies in our business and gain on sale of a divested business, partially offset by the negative impact of an increase in transaction expense.

[626]: REVENUE RECOGNITION [/626]
[627]: Application of the accounting principles in U.S. GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates. Complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting. Specifically, the determination of whether we are a principal to a transaction (gross revenue) or an agent (net revenue) can require considerable judgment. Further, we provide incentive payments to consumers and merchants. Evaluating whether these incentives are a payment to a customer, or consideration payable on behalf of a customer, requires judgment. Incentives determined to be made to a customer, or payable on behalf of a customer, are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue. Incentives that are earned by the customer based on performance targets [/627]
[629]: Table of Contents [/629]
[630]: are recorded when earned, based on management’s estimate of each customer’s future performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted, as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual customer performance, amendments to existing contracts, or the execution of new contracts. Changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the amount of revenue recognized. [/630]

[692]: To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of PayPal Holdings, Inc. [/692]
[693]: Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting [/693]
[694]: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of PayPal Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of income (loss), of comprehensive income (loss), of stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). [/694]
[548]: Cash flows [/548]
[549]: The following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows: [/549]
[551]: Operating activities [/551]
[552]: Cash flows from operating activities includes net income adjusted for certain non-cash expenses, timing differences between expenses recognized for provision for transaction and credit losses and actual cash transaction losses incurred, and changes in other assets and liabilities. Significant non-cash expenses for the period include depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation. The cash impact from actual transaction losses incurred during a period is reflected as changes in other assets and liabilities. The expenses recognized during the period for provision for credit losses are estimates of current expected credit losses on our merchant and consumer credit products. Actual charge-offs of receivables related to our merchants and consumer credit products have no impact on cash from operating activities. [/552]
[553]: The net cash provided by operating activities of $4.8 billion in 2023 was due primarily to operating income of $5.0 billion, as well as adjustments for non-cash expenses including provision for transaction and credit losses of $1.7 billion, stock-based compensation of $1.5 billion, and depreciation and amortization of $1.1 billion. Cash flows from operating activities was also impacted by proceeds from repayments and sales of loans receivable, originally classified as held for sale, of $10.8 billion and changes in other assets of $203 million. These changes, which favorably impacted cash generated from operations, were offset by originations of loans receivable, held for sale of $11.5 billion, actual cash transaction losses incurred during the period of $1.2 billion, changes in deferred income taxes of $668 million, gain on divestiture of business, excluding transaction costs, of $356 million, net accretion of investments purchased at a discount of $367 million, and changes in liabilities of $222 million.

[412]: Connect & Control Technologies [/412]
[413]: CCT revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $53.8 primarily driven by pricing actions and higher sales volume. Specifically, component sales grew 21%, primarily within the aerospace and defense markets, while connector sales grew 1%. The current year period also benefited $15.5 from our second quarter acquisition of Micro-Mode and $1.4 from favorable foreign currency translation. Excluding the impacts from acquisition and favorable foreign currency translation, organic revenue increased $36.9. [/413]
[414]: GROSS PROFIT [/414]
[415]: Gross profit for 2023 was $1,107.3, reflecting a gross margin of 33.7%. Gross profit for 2022 was $922.3, reflecting a gross margin of 30.9%. The increases in gross profit and gross margin were primarily driven by an increase in revenue, described above in the section titled ""R evenue"" , partially offset by increases in raw material, labor, and overhead costs, which were driven by inflationary pressures during the year, as discussed above in the section titled ""Global Macroeconomic Conditions"" . [/415]
[369]: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY [/369]
[370]: During 2023, despite evolving macroeconomic conditions, we delivered strong financial results, which included revenue and operating income growth, operating margin expansion, EPS growth and effective deployment of capital. The following table provides a summary of key performance indicators for 2023 in comparison to 2022. [/370]
[372]: See the section titled "" Key Performance Indicators and Non-GAAP Measures "" for a definition and reconciliation of organic revenue, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, and adjusted EPS. [/372]
[373]: Our 2023 results include: [/373]
[374]: • Revenue of $3,283.0 increased $295.3 due to higher sales volume and pricing actions, particularly within IP's aftermarket business, MT's Friction OE business, and CCT's components business. In addition, our 2023 results benefited by $30.5 from our recent acquisitions of Habonim and Micro-Mode Products, Inc. (""Micro-Mode""), and by $23.1 from favorable foreign currency translation. [/374]
[375]: • Operating income of $528.2 increased $60.2, primarily due to higher revenue, productivity savings, a gain of $7.2 on the sale of a product line within our CCT segment, lower charges related to the suspension of business in Russia, and the accretive impact of our recent acquisitions of Habonim and Micro-Mode. The increase in operating income was partially offset by higher labor, raw material and overhead costs, unfavorable foreign currency impacts and product mix, a loss of $15.3 on the sale of our Matrix Composites, Inc. (""Matrix"") business, and a prior year gain of $15.5 on the sale of facilities within our IP segment. [/375]

[538]: The accounting estimates and assumptions discussed below are those that we consider most critical to fully understanding our financial statements and evaluating our results as they are inherently uncertain, involve the most subjective or complex judgments, include areas where different estimates reasonably could have been used, and the use of an alternative estimate that is reasonably possible could materially affect the financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and other data and assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Management believes the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements are reasonable; however, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and assumptions. [/538]
[539]: Revenue Recognition [/539]
[540]: Revenue is derived from the sale of products and services to customers. We recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. For product sales, other than certain long-term construction and production type contracts where we have no alternative use for the product and have an enforceable right to payment, we recognize revenue at the time control of our promised goods or services passes to the customer, generally when products are shipped and the contractual terms have been fulfilled. [/540]
[422]: Sales and marketing expenses increased $17.1 for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily driven by higher personnel and other sales-related costs to support higher sales activity. The increase in personnel costs was partially attributable to higher headcount stemming from, and timing of, our recent Habonim and Micro-Mode acquisitions. [/422]
[423]: Research and development (R&D) expenses increased $6.1 for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily driven by higher personnel costs to support investments in innovation and new product development. [/423]
[424]: Gain on sale of long-lived assets decreased by $16.2 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The prior year period included a one-time gain of $15.5 related to the sale of facilities that were previously held within our IP segment. [/424]
[425]: OPERATING INCOME [/425]
[426]: The following table summarizes our operating income and operating margin by segment. [/426]
[428]: MT operating income for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $22.3 primarily due to higher revenue, as discussed above, productivity savings, and lower charges related to the suspension of business in Russia. The increase was partially offset by higher raw material, labor and overhead costs, as well as unfavorable foreign currency impacts and product mix. [/428]
[429]: IP operating income for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $56.0, driven by higher revenue, as discussed above, productivity savings, lower charges related to the suspension of business in Russia, and the accretive impact of the acquisition of Habonim, which occurred in the second quarter of 2022. The increase was partially offset by higher labor and overhead costs, and unfavorable foreign currency impacts. The prior year period also benefited from a non-recurring gain of $15.5 related to the sale of facilities. [/429]
[430]: CCT operating income for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased $8.3, driven by a $15.3 loss on the sale of our Matrix business, and higher raw material, labor and overhead costs. The decrease was partially offset by higher revenue, as discussed above, productivity savings, a gain of $7.2 related to the sale of a product line, and the accretive impact of the second quarter acquisition of Micro-Mode.

[761]: Note 2. REVENUE [/761]
[762]: The following table summarizes the disaggregation of revenue by nature: [/762]
[764]: Net product sales represent more than 95 % of total revenues for all periods presented. Products are sold principally to wholesalers, distributors, specialty pharmacies, and to a lesser extent, directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics and government agencies. Customer orders are generally fulfilled within a few days of receipt resulting in minimal order backlog. Contractual performance obligations are usually limited to transfer of control of the product to the customer. The transfer occurs either upon shipment, upon receipt of the product after considering when the customer obtains legal title to the product, or upon infusion for cell therapies and when BMS obtains a right of payment. At these points, customers are able to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits of the product. [/764]
[765]: Gross revenue to the three largest pharmaceutical wholesalers in the U.S. as a percentage of U.S. gross revenues was as follows: [/765]
[536]: Table element - Text before table: Our non-U.S. businesses have significantly more direct customers. Information on available direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information varies widely. We limit our direct customer sales channel inventory reporting to where we can influence demand. When this information does not exist or is otherwise not available, we have developed a variety of methodologies to estimate such data, including using historical sales made to direct customers and third-party market research data related to prescription trends and end-user demand. Given the difficulties inherent in estimating third-party demand information, we evaluate our methodologies to estimate direct customer product level inventory and to calculate months on hand on an ongoing basis and make changes as necessary. Factors that may affect our estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, price increases, new product launches, new warehouse openings by direct customers, new customer stockings by direct customers and expected direct customer purchases for governmental bidding situations. As such, all of the information required to estimate months on hand in the direct customer distribution channel for non-U.S. business for the year ended December 31, 2023 is not available prior to the filing of this 2023 Form 10-K. We will disclose any product with levels of inventory in excess of one month on hand or expected demand for the current quarter, subject to certain limited exceptions, in our next quarterly report on Form 10-Q.

[415]: Table element - Text before table: In January 2024, we acquired Mirati, a commercial stage targeted oncology company with a pipeline of commercial, clinical and pre-clinical stage oncology medicines and assets. With the Mirati acquisition, we obtained rights to Krazati *, a best-in-class inhibitor of KRASG12C mutation, approved by the FDA as a second-line treatment for patients with NSCLC; and MRTX1719, a potential first-in-class MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitor in Phase I development, among others. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2023, we entered into definitive merger agreements to acquire Karuna and RayzeBio and also entered into strategic collaboration with SystImmune. Karuna is a biopharmaceutical company driven to discover, develop and deliver transformative medicines for people living with psychiatric and neurological conditions. RayzeBio is a clinical-stage radiopharmaceutical therapeutics company with an innovation-leading position in actinium-based radiopharmaceutical therapeutics and a pipeline of potentially first-in-class and best-in-class drug development programs. Refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 4. Acquisitions, Divestitures, Licensing and Other Arrangements” for additional information. The goal of the collaboration with SystImmune is to co-develop and co-commercialize BL-B01D1, a bispecific topoisomerase inhibitor-based anti-body drug conjugate which targets both EGFR and HER3 and is currently being evaluated in a Phase I clinical trial for metastatic or unresectable NSCLC. Refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 3. Alliances” for further information.
The Company has the potential to increase its registrational portfolio from six to up to twelve potentially first-in-class/best-in-class assets. In addition to its growing registrational portfolio, the Company has more than 25 indication expansion opportunities on the horizon. Taken together, this leads to increased depth across the Company’s therapeutic areas, including oncology, hematology, immunology, cardiovascular and a growing presence in neuroscience.

[763]: Table element - Text before table: Business Combinations In October 2021, the FASB issued amended guidance on accounting for contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers in a business combination. The guidance is intended to address inconsistency related to recognition of an acquired contract liability and payment terms and their effect on subsequent revenue recognized. At the acquisition date, an entity should account for the related revenue contracts in accordance with existing revenue recognition guidance generally by assessing how the acquiree applied recognition and measurement in their financial statements. The guidance was adopted on January 1, 2023 and the adoption did not have an impact to the consolidated financial statements. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted Income Taxes In December 2023, the FASB issued amended guidance on income tax disclosures. The guidance is intended to provide additional disaggregation to the effective income tax rate reconciliation and income tax payment disclosures. The amended guidance is effective for annual periods beginning January 2025 and should be applied on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. Segment Reporting In November 2023, the FASB issued amended guidance for improvements to reportable segment disclosures. The revised guidance requires that a public entity disclose significant segment expenses regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (CODM), including public entities with a single reportable segment. The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning January 2024 and interim periods beginning January 2025 on a retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted.

[1057]: Table element - Text before table: MSUs are granted to executive officers. Vesting is conditioned upon continuous employment and occurs ratably over four years , subject to accelerated vesting in specified circumstances. The number of shares issued upon vesting of MSUs is determined based on a specified payout factor requiring that the market price per share at a specified measurement date be at least 80 % of the grant-date share price (market condition) for awards granted in 2023 ( 60 % prior to 2022). Attainment of a higher payout factor, calculated as the share price on measurement date divided by share price on award date, results in a higher percentage payout of MSUs, up to a maximum of 225 % of the target number of MSUs for awards granted in 2023 ( 200 % prior to 2022). The share price used in the payout factor is calculated using an average of the closing prices on the grant date or measurement date, and the nine trading days immediately preceding the grant date or measurement date.
PSUs are granted to executive officers, have a three-year performance cycle and are granted as a target number of stock units subject to adjustment. The number of shares issued when PSUs vest is determined based on the achievement of specified performance goals (a performance condition) and based on BMS’s three-year relative total shareholder return compound annual growth rate relative to a peer group of companies (a market condition) for awards granted in 2023 ( three-year total shareholder return relative to a peer group of companies prior to 2023) and can range from 0 % to a maximum of 200 % of the target number of PSUs. Vesting is conditioned upon continuous employment and occurs on the third anniversary of the grant date, subject to accelerated vesting in specified circumstances.
Stock-based compensation expense for awards ultimately expected to vest is recognized over the vesting period. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.

[694]: No individual country, other than the United States, generated more than 10% of net revenue in any such period.  A significant portion of our net revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers.  In 2023, the net revenue from these customers was approximately $5.6 billion, or 22%, of total net revenue.  The loss of any of these customers or their significant card programs could adversely impact our revenue. [/694]

[696]: Operating expenses increased 11% in 2023 versus the prior year.  Adjusted operating expenses increased 10%, or 11% on a currency-neutral basis, versus the prior year, which includes a 1 percentage point increase from acquisitions.  On both an as reported and as adjusted basis, the increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs to support the continued investment in our business and the delivery of services to our customers.

[863]: Revenue recognition - Revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of promised services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services. Revenue from the Company’s payment network is primarily generated by charging fees to customers (issuers, acquirers and other market participants) for providing switching and other network-related services, as well as by charging fees to customers based primarily on the gross dollar volume of activity (GDV, which includes both domestic and cross-border volume) on the cards that carry the Company’s brands.  Revenue is recognized in the period in which the related transactions and volume occur.  Certain volume-based revenue is determined from information reported by customers. Revenue from the Company’s value-added services and solutions is generated through either fixed or transaction-based fees.  These services and solutions can be integrated and sold with the Company’s payment network services or can be sold on a stand-alone basis.  Revenue from the Company’s value-added services and solutions is recognized in the period in which the related services and solutions are performed or transactions occur.  For services provided to customers where delivery involves the use of a third-party, the Company recognizes revenue on a gross basis if it acts as the principal, controlling the service to the customer, or on a net basis if it acts as the agent, arranging for the service to be provided. Mastercard has business agreements with certain customers that provide for rebates and incentives within net revenue that could be either fixed or variable.  Fixed incentives typically represent payments to a customer directly related to entering into an agreement, which are generally capitalized and amortized over the life of the agreement on a straight-line basis.  Variable rebates and incentives are recorded primarily when volume- and transaction-based revenues are recognized over the contractual term.  Variable rebates and incentives are calculated based upon estimated customer performance, such as volume thresholds, and the terms of the related business agreements. Certain of the Company’s contracts may include options to receive additional value-added services and solutions.  The Company accounts for the option as a distinct performance obligation if the option provides a material right to the customer.  Material rights are incremental to the standard offerings, which a customer would not have received without entering into the contract.  If a material right exists in a contract, revenue allocated to the option is deferred and recognized as revenue when those future products or services are transferred or when the option expires.  The value of the option is based on observable prices in the contract or on a relative standalone selling price (“SSP”) basis.  The SSP is the price at which the Company would sell a promised product or service separately in similar circumstances to similar customers. Contract assets include unbilled consideration typically resulting from executed value-added services and solutions performed for customers in connection with Mastercard’s payments network service arrangements.  Collection for these services typically occurs over the contractual term.  Contract assets are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company defers the recognition of revenue when consideration has been received prior to the satisfaction of performance obligations.  As these performance obligations are satisfied, revenue is subsequently recognized.  Deferred revenue primarily relates to certain value-added services and solutions.  Deferred revenue is included in other current liabilities and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Business combinations - The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting.  The Company measures the tangible and intangible identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and contingent consideration at fair value as of the acquisition date.  Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and are included in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations.  Any excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, is recorded as goodwill.  Measurement period adjustments, if any, to the preliminary estimated fair value of the intangibles assets as of the acquisition date are recorded in goodwill. Goodwill and other intangible assets - Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of goodwill and customer relationships.  Goodwill represents the synergies expected to arise after the acquisition date and the assembled workforce.  Finite-lived intangible assets consist of capitalized software costs, other intangible assets acquired in business combinations (including customer relationships and acquired technology) and other intangible assets.  Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives, on a straight-line basis, which range from one to twenty years .  Capitalized software includes internal and external costs incurred directly related to the design, development and testing phases of each capitalized software project. The valuation methods for goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in business combinations involve assumptions concerning comparable company multiples, discount rates, growth projections and other assumptions of future business conditions.  The Company uses various valuation techniques to determine the fair value of its intangible assets, primarily discounted cash flows analysis, relief-from-royalty and multi-period excess earnings.  As the assumptions employed to measure these assets are based on [/863]

[/1419]
[1420]: Segment Assets [/1420]
[1421]: We manage our assets on a total company basis, not by operating segment. Therefore, our chief operating decision maker does not regularly review any asset information by operating segment and, accordingly, we do not report asset information by operating segment. Total assets were approximately $ 14.3 billion and $ 14.9 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. [/1421]

These costs also include certain compensation costs, certain procurement costs and other miscellaneous operating expenses not charged to our operating segments, as well as interest income and expense. [/1417]
[1418]: •    Certain transactions and events such as (i) Purchase accounting adjustments , where we incur expenses associated with the amortization of fair value adjustments to inventory, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment; (ii) Acquisition-related activities , where we incur costs associated with acquiring and integrating newly acquired businesses, such as transaction costs and integration costs; and (iii) Certain significant items , which comprise substantive, unusual items that, either as a result of their nature or size, would not be expected to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis, such as restructuring charges and implementation costs associated with our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives that are not associated with an acquisition, certain asset impairment charges, certain legal and commercial settlements and the impact of divestiture-related gains and losses. [/1418]
[692]: Operational Growth [/692]
[693]: We believe that it is important to not only understand overall revenue and earnings growth, but also “operational growth.” Operational growth is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as revenue or earnings growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This measure provides information on the change in revenue and earnings as if foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the current and prior periods to facilitate a period-to-period comparison. We believe this non-GAAP measure provides a useful comparison to previous periods for the company and investors, but should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP reported growth. [/693]
[694]: Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share [/694]
[695]: Adjusted net income and the corresponding adjusted earnings per share (EPS) are non-GAAP financial measures of performance used by management. We believe these financial measures are useful supplemental information to investors when considered together with our U.S. GAAP financial measures. We report adjusted net income to portray the results of our major operations, and the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization of our products, prior to considering certain income statement elements. We define adjusted net income and adjusted EPS as net income attributable to Zoetis and EPS before the impact of purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items. [/695]
[701]: (a) Amortization expense related to finite-lived acquired intangible assets that contribute to our ability to sell, manufacture, research, market and distribute products, compounds and intellectual property is included in Amortization of intangible assets as these intangible assets benefit multiple business functions. Amortization expense related to finite-lived acquired intangible assets that are associated with a single function is included in Cost of sales , Selling, general and administrative expenses or Research and development expenses , as appropriate.

[710]: Total revenue increased by $464 million, or 6%, in 2023 compared with 2022 reflecting operational revenue growth of $579 million, or 7%. Operational revenue growth was primarily due to the following: [/710]
[711]: • price growth of approximately 5%; and [/711]
[712]: • volume growth from new products of approximately 2%. [/712]

[833]: Table element - Text before table: The lower effective tax rate for 2023, compared with 2022, was primarily attributable to a higher benefit in the U.S. related to foreign-derived intangible income, a more favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings (which includes the impact of the location of earnings and repatriation costs), partially offset by a higher net discrete tax expense in 2023, mainly related to changes to prior years’ tax positions. Jurisdictional mix of earnings can vary depending on repatriation decisions, operating fluctuations in the normal course of business and the impact of non-deductible and non-taxable items.

[794]: 2023 vs. 2022 [/794]
[795]: Other business activities net loss increased by $72 million, or 17%, in 2023 compared with 2022, reflecting an increase in R&D costs due to an increase in certain compensation-related costs to support innovation, an increase in operating costs and higher project investments, as well as lower earnings in our human health business, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange. [/795]
[796]: Reconciling items [/796]

[798]: • Corporate, which includes certain costs associated with information technology, facilities, legal, finance, human resources, business development, certain diagnostics costs and communications, among others. These costs also include certain compensation costs, certain procurement costs, and other miscellaneous operating expenses that are not charged to our operating segments, as well as interest income and expense; [/798]
[799]: • Certain transactions and events such as Purchase accounting adjustments , Acquisition-related activities and Certain significant items , which are defined below; and [/799]
[641]: Amortization of intangible assets consists primarily of the amortization expense for identifiable finite-lived intangible assets that have been acquired through business combinations. These assets consist of, but are not limited to, developed technology, brands and trademarks. [/641]
[642]: Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs consist of all restructuring charges (those associated with cost reduction/productivity initiatives and those associated with acquisition activity), as well as costs associated with acquiring and integrating businesses. Restructuring charges [/642]

[646]: Other (income)/deductions—net consists of various items, primarily net (gains)/losses on business sales and divestitures, as well as asset disposals, interest income, royalty-related income, foreign exchange translation (gains)/losses and certain asset impairment charges. [/646]
[699]: Table element - Text before table: We recognize that, as an internal measure of performance, the adjusted net income and adjusted EPS measures have limitations, and we do not restrict our performance management process solely to these metrics. A limitation of the adjusted net income and adjusted EPS measures is that they provide a view of our operations without including all events during a period, such as the effects of an acquisition or amortization of purchased intangibles, and do not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies. The adjusted net income and adjusted EPS measures are not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for U.S. GAAP reported net income attributable to Zoetis and reported EPS.

[519]: Consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by 7.6% to $9,654.4 million, compared to $8,975.5 million for the prior year. The increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in transaction volumes, including from the EVO business acquired in 2023. [/519]
[520]: Merchant Solutions Segment. Revenues from our Merchant Solutions segment for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by 15.3% to $7,151.8 million, compared to $6,204.9 million for the prior year. The increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in transaction volumes, including from the EVO business, and growth in subscription and software revenue. [/520]
[521]: Issuer Solutions Segment. Revenues from our Issuer Solutions segment for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by 6.8% to $2,398.9 million, compared to $2,245.6 million for the prior year. The increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in transaction volumes. [/521]

[532]: Segment Operating Income and Operating Margin [/532]
[533]: In our Merchant Solutions segment, operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased compared to the prior year primarily due to the favorable effect of the increase in revenues, since certain fixed costs do not vary with revenues, and continued expense management. These favorable effects were partially offset by incremental expenses related to continued investment in products, innovation and our technology environments. In addition, the inclusion of EVO had an unfavorable effect on the Merchant Solutions operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the prior year. [/533]

[670]: REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM [/670]
[671]: To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Global Payments Inc. [/671]
[672]: Opinion on the Financial Statements [/672]
[673]: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Global Payments Inc. and subsidiaries (the ""Company"") as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the ""financial statements""). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. [/673]
[525]: Selling, general and administrative expenses included acquisition and integration expenses of $341.4 million and $258.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Share-based compensation expense was $209.0 million and $163.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. [/525]
[526]: Corporate. Corporate expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $898.0 million, compared to $777.7 million for the prior year. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to the increase in acquisition and integration and compensation expenses, partially offset by lower charges related to facilities exit activities in the current year. [/526]
[527]: Operating Income and Operating Margin [/527]
[528]: Consolidated operating income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $1,716.4 million, compared to $640.2 million for the prior year. Consolidated operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year included the favorable effects of the increase in revenues, since certain fixed costs do not vary with revenues, prudent expense management and lower charges related to facilities exit activities as described above. These effects were partially offset by higher acquisition and integration expenses, amortization of acquired intangibles and compensation expenses as described above. Consolidated operating income for the year ended December 31, 2023 also included the effects of a $106.9 million gain on the sale of our gaming business and a $243.6 million loss on the sale of our consumer business. [/528]
[499]: Operating Expenses [/499]
[500]: Cost of Service. Cost of service consists primarily of salaries, wages and related expenses paid to operations and technology-related personnel, including those who monitor our transaction processing systems and settlement functions; the cost of transaction processing systems, including third-party services; the cost of network telecommunications capability; depreciation and occupancy costs associated with the facilities supporting these functions; amortization of intangible assets; costs to fulfill customer contracts; provisions for operating losses; and, when applicable, integration costs. [/500]
[501]: Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, wages, commissions and related expenses paid to sales personnel, customer support functions other than those supporting revenues, administrative employees and management; share-based compensation; costs to obtain customer contracts; residuals paid to ISOs; fees paid to VARs, independent contractors and other third parties; other selling expenses; occupancy costs of leased space directly related to these functions; advertising costs; and, when applicable, acquisition and integration costs. [/501]
[623]: When applying the quantitative assessment, we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighted average of multiple valuation techniques, principally a combination of an income approach and a market approach. The income approach calculates a value based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows, while the market approach uses earnings multiples of similarly situated guideline public companies. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions . [/623]
[624]: During the second quarter of 2022, the sustained decline in our share price and increases in discount rates, primarily resulting from increased economic uncertainty, indicated a potential decline in fair value and triggered a requirement to evaluate our Issuer Solutions and former Business and Consumer Solutions reporting units for potential impairment as of June 30, 2022. Furthermore, the estimated sales price for the consumer business portion of our former Business and Consumer Solutions reporting unit also indicated a potential decline in fair value as of June 30, 2022. We determined on the basis of the quantitative assessment that the fair value of our Issuer Solutions reporting unit was still greater than its carrying amount, indicating no impairment. Based on the quantitative assessment of our former Business and Consumer Solutions reporting unit, including consideration of the consumer business disposal group and the remaining assets of the reporting unit, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $833.1 million in our consolidated statement of income during the three months ended June 30, 2022.

[851]: Valuation of Identified Intangible Assets [/851]
[852]: For the acquisitions discussed above, the estimated fair values of customer-related and contract-based intangible assets were generally determined using the income approach, which was based on projected cash flows discounted to their present value using discount rates that consider the timing and risk of the forecasted cash flows. The discount rates used represented a risk adjusted market participant weighted-average cost of capital, derived using customary market metrics. Acquired technologies were valued using the replacement cost method, which required us to estimate the costs to construct an asset of equivalent utility at prices available at the time of the valuation analysis, with adjustments in value for physical deterioration and functional and economic obsolescence. Trademarks and trade names were valued using the ""relief-from-royalty"" approach. This method assumes that trademarks and trade names have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method required us to estimate the future revenues for the related assets, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted-average cost of capital. [/852]
[697]: • With the assistance of our IT specialists, we: [/697]
[698]: ◦ Identified the significant systems used to process revenue transactions and tested the general IT controls over each of these systems, including testing of user access controls, change management controls, and IT operations controls. [/698]
[699]: ◦ Tested system interface controls and automated controls within the relevant revenue streams, as well as the controls designed to ensure the accuracy and completeness of revenues. [/699]
[700]: • We tested controls within the relevant revenue business processes, including those in place to reconcile the various reports extracted from the IT systems to the Company’s general ledger. [/700]
[701]: • We evaluated trends in recorded revenues, including interchange fees and payment network fees. [/701]
[702]: • For a sample of revenue transactions, we tested selected transactions by agreeing the amounts of revenue recognized to source documents and tested the mathematical accuracy of the recorded revenues. [/702]
[703]: • We developed independent expectations of certain revenue streams and compared these to amounts recorded by the Company. [/703]
[452]: We operate in two reportable segments: Merchant Solutions and Issuer Solutions. During the second quarter of 2023, we completed the sale of the consumer portion of our Netspend business, which comprised our former Consumer Solutions segment.

[691]: Revenues - Payment processing solutions and services - Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements . [/691]
[692]: Critical Audit Matter Description [/692]
[693]: The Company's revenues from its payment processing solutions and services consist of activity-based fees made up of a significant volume of low-dollar transactions, sourced from multiple systems and applications. The processing of transactions and recording of revenues is highly automated and is based on contractual terms with merchants, financial institutions, financial service providers, payment networks, and other parties. [/693]
[694]: We identified payment processing solutions and services revenues as a critical audit matter given the increased extent of effort, including the need for us to involve professionals with expertise in information technology (IT), to identify, test, and evaluate the Company's systems, software applications, and automated controls. [/694]
[695]: How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit [/695]
[696]: Our audit procedures related to the Company's systems to process payment services revenues included the following, among others: [/696]
[880]: As a result of actions taken during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 to reduce our facility footprint in certain markets around the world, we recognized charges of $ 1.6 million, $ 7.5 million and $ 9.2 million, respectively, in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income, primarily related to certain leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures and equipment, to reduce the carrying amount of each asset group to the estimated fair value. [/880]
[881]: NOTE 6— GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS [/881]
[882]: As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, goodwill and other intangible assets consisted of the following: [/882]
[884]: 84 [/884]
[885]: Table of Contents [/885]
[886]: The following table sets forth the changes by reportable segment in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021: [/886]
[888]: (1) Reflects goodwill derecognized in connection with the sale of our Merchant Solutions business in Russia. See “Note 3—Business Dispositions” for further discussion. [/888]
[889]: (2) Reflects a goodwill impairment charge related to our former Business and Consumer Solutions reporting unit. In connection with the change in presentation of segment information during the year ended December 31, 2022, accumulated impairment losses associated with our former Business and Consumer Solutions reporting unit were reallocated to our new reporting units based on relative fair value. See ""Note 1— Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"" for further discussion. [/889]
[522]: Operating Expenses [/522]
[523]: Cost of Service. Cost of service for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $3,727.5 million, compared to $3,778.6 million for the prior year. Cost of service as a percentage of revenues decreased to 38.6% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 42.1% for the prior year. Compared to the prior year, cost of service for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased primarily due to continued prudent expense management and inclusion of costs related to the divested businesses for only a portion of the current year. These favorable effects were partially offset by the inclusion of costs for the EVO business, including the related amortization of acquired intangibles. Cost of service included amortization of acquired intangibles of $1,318.5 million and $1,263.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. [/523]
[524]: Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by 15.6% to $4,073.8 million, compared to $3,524.6 million for the prior year. Selling, general and administrative"

[594]: Revenue recognition – subscription and services revenue [/594]
[595]: As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized subscription and services revenue of $283.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company derives its revenues primarily from subscriptions, services, and associated software maintenance and support. A portion of the Company's customer contracts contain multiple performance obligations. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. [/595]
[596]: The principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition - subscription and services revenue is a critical audit matter is a high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures related to the Company’s revenue recognition. [/596]
[597]: Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls over the recognition of subscription and services revenue and allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing the completeness, accuracy, and occurrence of revenue recognized for a sample of revenue transactions by obtaining and inspecting source documents, such as contracts, proof of delivery, invoices, and subsequent payment receipts; (ii) testing, on a sample basis, the accuracy of management’s calculation of the transaction price and the allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price; and (iii) confirming a sample of outstanding customer invoice balances as of December 31, 2023 and, for confirmations not returned, obtaining and inspecting source documents, such as contracts, proof of delivery, invoices, and subsequent payment receipts. [/597]
[416]: Services revenue. Services revenue increased primarily as a result of higher sales of professional services to our existing customers. Services revenue varies from period to period depending on different factors, including the level of professional services required to implement our solutions, the timing of services revenue recognition on certain subscription contracts and efficiencies in our solutions implementations requiring less professional services during a particular period.

[419]: Cost of revenue and gross profit: [/419]
[421]: Cost of subscription. Cost of subscription increased primarily due to higher infrastructure costs to support the growth in our subscription customer base and higher employee-related costs mainly due to an increase in headcount. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in amortization expense for developed technology intangible assets. Our subscription gross profit percentages were 76% and 73% for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. [/421]

During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company identified an observable price change related to another equity investment. The change was determined to be a decrease in fair value below the carrying cost of the equity investment and the Company recorded an impairment loss of $ 2.0 million in other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss. As of December 31, 2023 and 2021, the Company determined there were no impairments on its equity investments. [/733]

Performance Obligations As of December 31, 2023, the Company expects to recognize approximately $ 469.6 million of revenue from remaining performance obligations. The Company expects to recognize revenue on approximately $ 227.5 million of these performance obligations over the next 12 months, with the balance recognized thereafter. [/735]

[824]: Indemnification [/824]
[825]: The Company’s software agreements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if the Company’s software solutions infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights. To date, the Company has not incurred any losses as a result of such indemnifications and has not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. [/825]
[826]: 19. Segment and Geographic Information [/826]
[827]: The Company operates as one segment with a single reporting unit. Operating segments are the components of an enterprise where separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision-maker, who is the Company's Chief Executive Officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assessing financial performance. The Company's chief operating decision-maker allocates resources and assesses performance based upon discrete financial information at the consolidated level. Revenue by Geography The Company presents financial information on a consolidated basis and does not assess the profitability of its geographic regions. Accordingly, the Company does not attempt to comprehensively assign or allocate costs to these regions and does not produce reports for, or measure the performance of, its geographic regions based on any asset-based metrics. International revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, amounted to approximately $ 196.7 million, $ 177.8 million and $ 162.5 million, respectively, representing 65 %, 64 % and 65 %, respectively, of annual revenue.

[506]: We account for uncertain income tax positions recognized in our financial statements in accordance with the Income Tax Topic of the Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC""), issued by the FASB. This interpretation requires companies to use a prescribed model for assessing the financial recognition and measurement of all tax positions taken or expected to be taken in their tax returns. This guidance provides clarification on recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosures and transition. Please see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. [/506]

[669]: Segment Reporting The Company reports as one operating segment with the Chief Executive Officer (""CEO"") acting as the Company’s chief operating decision maker. The Company’s CEO reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. The Company has a single reporting unit, and there are no segment managers who are held accountable for operations, operating results or components below the consolidated unit level. Earnings Per Share The Company computes basic earnings (loss) per share by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by giving effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible notes using the if-converted method. Dilutive potential common shares consist of shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options, shares of unvested restricted stock units, market stock units and equity consideration, and settlement of stock appreciation rights, if any. When the Company incurs a net loss, the effect of the Company's outstanding stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, market stock units, equity consideration and convertible notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings (loss) per share as the effect would be anti-dilutive. Accordingly, basic and diluted net loss per share are identical. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08 , Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contract with Customers (""Topic 805"") , which amends ASC 805 to require acquiring entities to apply Topic 606 to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination. This new standard is effective for the Company's interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2023, and earlier adoption is permitted. The Company early adopted Topic 805 in the fourth quarter of 2021 and there was no impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements as of the adoption date. The Company appli ed the standard prospectively to the acquisition of EveryMundo which occurred in November 2021. In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (""Subtopic 470-20"") and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity (""Subtopic 815-40"") , which simplifies the accounting for certain convertible instruments, amends the guidance on derivative scope exceptions for contracts in an entity's own equity, and modifies the guidance on diluted earnings per share calculations as a result of these changes. This new standard is effective for the Company's interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2022, and earlier adoption is permitted on January 1, 2021. The Company may elect to apply the amendments on a retrospective or modified retrospective basis. The Company early adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2021 on the modified retrospective basis. The adoption decreased additional paid-in capital by $ 80.1 million related to the equity conversion component of the outstanding convertible notes which was previously separated and recorded in equity, and increased convertible debt, net by $ 68.8 million related to the removal of the debt discounts and adjustment of debt issuance cost recorded under the previous standard. The net cumulative effect of the adjustments of $ 11.3 million was recorded as a decrease to the opening balance of the accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2021. The adoption had no impact on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The ASU is to be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures which expands disclosures in an entity’s income tax rate reconciliation table and disclosures regarding income taxes paid by jurisdiction. The new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and early adoption is permitted. The new standard is to be applied on a prospective basis, but retrospective application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. [/669]
[840]: In the first quarter of 2023, the Company made certain organizational changes and incurred approximately $ 3.6 million of severance, employee benefits, outplacement and related costs. These costs were recorded primarily as operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss, mainly research and development, and sales and marketing. During the year ended December 31, 2023 , cash payments of $ 4.1 million were recorded for the incurred severance costs. As of December 31, 2023, all severance and other related costs were fully paid. [/840]

[639]: 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies [/639]
[640]: Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation These Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (""GAAP""). Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. Such reclassifications impacted the classification of general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses. These insignificant reclassifications had no effect on the reported results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. Changes in Accounting Policies The Company has consistently applied the accounting policies described in this Note 2 to all periods presented in these Consolidated Financial Statements, except for the Company's adoption of certain accounting standards described in more detail under "" Recently adopted accounting pronouncements "" in this Note 2 below. Dollar Amounts The dollar amounts presented in the tabular data within these footnote disclosures are stated in thousands of dollars, except per share amounts, or as noted within the context of each footnote disclosure. Use of Estimates The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses during the reporting period. The judgment required in the Company's estimation process, as well as issues related to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent in determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations and determining the standalone selling price of performance obligations, affect the amounts of revenue, expenses, unbilled receivables and deferred revenue. Estimates are also used for, but not limited to, receivables, allowance for credit losses, the determination of the period of benefit for deferred commissions, operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities, useful lives of assets, depreciation and amortization, fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for business combinations, income taxes and deferred tax asset valuation, valuation of stock awards, other current liabilities and accrued liabilities. Numerous internal and external factors can affect estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences could be material to the Company's consolidated financial position and results of operations. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase, or the ability to be settled in cash within a period of three months, to be cash equivalents, except for commercial paper which is classified as short-term investments, if any. The Company has a cash management program that provides for the investment of excess cash balances, primarily in short-term treasury and money market instruments. [/640]
[422]: Cost of maintenance and support. Cost of maintenance and support decreased due to lower personnel costs as our maintenance customer base declined primarily with migrations to our subscription solutions. Maintenance and support gross profit percentages for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, were 61% and 72%, respectively. Gross profit percentages decreased in 2023 as compared to prior year primarily due to lower maintenance and support revenue an d the cost of maintenance and support being relatively fixed. [/422]
[423]: Cost of services. Cost of services increased primarily due to higher personnel costs to support the increase in our services revenue during the period. Services gross profit percentages for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, were (1)% and (8)%, respectively. Services gross profit percentages improved in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to an increase in services revenue and a lesser increase in cost of services due to greater efficiencies. [/423]
[424]: Operating expenses : [/424]
[426]: Selling and marketing expenses. Selling and marketing expenses decreased primarily due to decreases in employee-related costs mainly due to prior organizational headcount changes and intangible asset amortization expense. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in travel expenses, sales and marketing events and other initiatives. [/426]

[643]: Trade and Other Receivables Trade and other receivables are primarily comprised of trade receivables, net of allowance for credit losses, contract assets and unbilled receivables. The Company records trade accounts receivable for its unconditional rights to consideration arising from the Company's performance under contracts with customers. The Company's standard billing terms are generally within thirty to sixty days from the date of the invoice. The carrying value of such receivables, net of the allowance for credit losses, represents their estimated net realizable value. When developing its estimate of expected credit losses on trade and other receivables, the Company considers the available information relevant to assessing the collectability of cash flows, which includes a combination of both internal and external information relating to past events, current conditions, and future forecasts as well as relevant qualitative and quantitative factors that relate to the environment in which the Company operates. Contract assets represent conditional rights to consideration that have been recognized as revenue in advance of billing the customer. Unbilled receivables represent unconditional rights to consideration arising from revenue that have been recognized in advance of billing the customer. Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets Prepaid expenses and other assets consist primarily of prepaid third-party software subscription and license fees, deferred project costs and prepaid taxes. Property and Equipment, Net Property and equipment are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance, repairs and minor replacements are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation on property and equipment, with the exception of leasehold improvements, is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation on leasehold improvements is recorded using the shorter of the lease term or useful life. When property is retired or disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gains or losses are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss in the period of disposal. Internal-Use Software Costs incurred to develop internal-use software during the application development stage are capitalized, stated at cost, and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Application development stage costs generally include salaries and personnel costs and third-party contractor expenses associated with internal"

[684]: opportunities and any other information that could impact the Company’s estimates of revenue and costs. After completing this analysis, any adjustments to net sales, cost of goods sold, and the related impact to operating income are recognized as necessary in the period they become known. Generally, the Company’s revenue contains a single performance obligation for each distinct good or service; however, a single contract may have multiple performance obligations comprising multiple promises to customers. When there are multiple performance obligations, revenue is allocated based on the relative stand-alone selling price. Pricing is defined in our contracts on a line item basis and includes an estimate of variable consideration when required by the terms of the individual customer contract. Types of variable consideration the Company typically has include volume discounts, prompt payment discounts, price escalation clauses, liquidating damages, and performance bonuses. Sales returns and allowances are also estimated and recognized in the same period the related revenue is recognized, based upon the Company’s experience and future expectations. [/684]
[591]: Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Management uses its best judgment in the determination of these amounts. However, the liabilities ultimately realized and paid are dependent on various matters including the resolution of the tax audits in the various affected tax jurisdictions and may differ from the amounts recorded. An adjustment to the estimated liability would be recorded through income in the period in which new information changes the expected outcome of an uncertain tax position. A deferred tax valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. [/591]
[592]: Revenue Recognition: [/592]
[593]: Description Revenue is recognized in accordance with ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The Company recognizes a portion of its revenues on long-term customer agreements involving the design and production of highly engineered products that require revenue to be recognized over time because these products have no alternative use without significant economic loss and the agreements contain an enforceable right to payment including a reasonable profit margin from the customer in the event of contract termination. Generally, the Company uses an input method for determining the amount of revenue, cost and gross margin to recognize over time for these customer agreements. The input method used for these agreements recognizes revenue based on our efforts to satisfy the performance obligation and includes costs of material and labor, both of which give an accurate representation of the progress made toward complete satisfaction of a particular performance obligation. The Company may also use the output method which recognizes revenue based on direct measurements of the value transferred to the customer. [/593]
[563]: Critical Accounting Estimates [/563]
[564]: The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Areas of uncertainty that require judgments, estimates and assumptions include the accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts, inventories, business combinations, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, warranty reserves, income taxes, and revenue recognition. Management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments and estimates, and actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions that are used to prepare the Company’s financial statements at any given time. Despite these inherent limitations, management believes that Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) and the financial statements and related footnotes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the Company.

 (col 1): Over Time Revenue Recognition for Long-Term Contracts (row end);
 (row 2) 
 (col 0): Description of the Matter (col 1): As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has long-term customer arrangements involving the design and production of highly engineered products that require revenue to be recognized over time. The Company uses input-based measures for determining the amount of revenue, cost, and gross margin to recognize over time for these customer arrangements. The input methods used for these arrangements include costs of material and labor. During the year ended December 31, 2023, a material amount of the Company's total revenues were derived from performance obligations that are satisfied over time. Auditing the Company's measurement of revenue recognized over time on long-term contracts is especially challenging because it involves subjective management assumptions regarding the estimated remaining costs of the long-term contract that could span several years. These assumptions could be impacted by the future cost of materials, labor availability and productivity, complexity of the work to be performed, and the performance of suppliers, customers and subcontractors that may be associated with the contract and may be affected by future market or economic conditions. (row end);
 (row 3) 
 (col 0): How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit (col 1): We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's process to recognize revenue over time on long-term contracts, including controls over management’s review of the significant underlying assumptions described above. Our audit procedures also included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions and the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data used in management's calculations. This included, for example, inspection of the executed contract and testing management's cost estimates by comparing the inputs to the Company’s historical data or experience for similar contracts, the performance of sensitivity analysis and the performance of retrospective review analysis of prior management cost estimates to actual costs incurred for completed contracts. In addition, for a sample of contracts, we involved our construction and engineering specialists to assist in our evaluation of management’s cost estimates at completion. (row end);
 [/626]
[575]: Business Combinations: [/575]
[576]: Description The Company accounts for business acquisitions in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, which requires the purchase price of the acquired business to be allocated to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the respective fair values. The amount of purchase price which is in excess of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. [/576]
[577]: Judgments and Uncertainties Discounted cash flow models are used to estimate the fair values of acquired contract backlog, customer relationships, intellectual property intangibles and trade names. The significant assumptions used to estimate the value of the intangible assets include revenue growth rates, projected profit margins, discount rates, royalty rates, customer attrition rates, revenue obsolescence rates and market participant profit margins. These significant assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. [/577]

[701]: The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were determined using the income, cost and market approaches. These estimates are preliminary in nature and subject to adjustments, which could be material as the Company has not completed its valuation of acquired assets and liabilities. Any necessary adjustments will be finalized within one year from the date of acquisition. [/701]
[702]: Goodwill was calculated as the difference between the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred and the fair value of the net assets acquired and represents the assembled workforce and the future economic benefits of expanding our global operations expected to be achieved as a result of the acquisition. The purchased goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The results of this business since the date of acquisition are reported within the Equipment product line of the Freight Segment. The pro forma impact on Wabtec’s sales and results of operations, including the pro forma effect of events that are directly attributable to the acquisition, was not significant. [/702]

[974]: We identified the evaluation of goodwill for impairment for the News and Advertising and Telecommunications reporting units as a critical audit matter. Challenging auditor judgment and involvement of valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge were required to evaluate certain assumptions used to estimate the fair value of these reporting units, such as revenue growth rates, long-term growth rates, and discount rates. Changes in these assumptions could have had a significant impact on the Company’s assessment of each reporting unit’s carrying value of goodwill. [/974]
[975]: The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the annual goodwill impairment testing. This included controls related to the Company’s development of revenue growth rates, long-term growth rates, and discount rates. We performed sensitivity analyses over the revenue growth rate, long-term growth rate, [/975]
[635]: Key Factors Impacting Operating Results and Financial Condition [/635]
[636]: Our future performance is dependent, to a large extent, on the impact of direct competition, general economic conditions (including capital and credit market conditions), our ability to manage our businesses effectively, and our relative strength and leverage in the marketplace, both with suppliers and customers. For more information, see ""Risk Factors"" and ""Business-Competition"" included herein. [/636]
[637]: We derive revenue principally through monthly charges to residential customers of our broadband, video, telephony and mobile services. We also derive revenue from DVR, VOD, pay-per-view, installation and home shopping commissions. Our residential broadband, video, telephony and mobile services accounted for approximately 41%, 33%, 3%, and 1% respectively, of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. We also derive revenue from the sale of a wide and growing variety of products and services to both large enterprise and SMB customers, including broadband, telephony, networking, video and mobile services. For the year ended December 31, 2023, 16% of our consolidated revenue was derived from these business services. In addition, we derive revenue from the sale of advertising inventory available on the programming carried on our cable television systems, as well as other systems (linear revenue), digital advertising, data analytics and affiliation fees for news programming, which accounted for approximately 5% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our other revenue, which includes mobile equipment revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2023 accounted for approximately 1% of our consolidated revenue. [/637]

These costs include materials, subcontractor labor, internal labor, and other related costs associated with the connection activities. Departmental activities supporting the connection process are capitalized based on time-weighted activity allocations of costs. These installation costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the CPE. The portion of departmental costs related to disconnecting services and removing CPE from a customer, costs related to connecting CPE that has been previously connected to the network, and repair and maintenance are expensed as incurred.

[1060]: other cable operators to jointly sell local advertising. In some of these markets, we represent the advertising sales efforts of other cable operators; in other markets, other cable operators represent us. We also offer customers the opportunity to advertise on digital platforms. Advertising revenues are recognized when the advertising is distributed. For arrangements in which we control the sale of advertising and act as the principal to the transaction, we recognize revenue earned from the advertising customer on a gross basis and the amount remitted to the distributor as an operating expense. For arrangements in which we do not control the sale of advertising and act as an agent to the transaction, we recognize revenue net of any fee remitted to the distributor. Revenue earned from the data-driven, audience-based advertising solutions using advanced analytics tools is recognized when services are provided. Affiliation fee revenue derived by our news business is recognized as the programming services are provided. Other Revenue Other revenue includes r evenue derived from the sale of mobile devices which is recognized upon delivery and acceptance of the equipment by the customer. Revenues derived from other sources are recognized when services are provided or events occur. Customer Contract Costs Incremental costs incurred in obtaining a contract with a customer are deferred and recorded as an asset if the period of benefit is expected to be greater than one year. Sales commissions for enterprise customers are deferred and amortized over the average contract term. As the amortization period for sales commission expenses related to residential and SMB customers is less than one year, we utilize the practical expedient and are recognizing the costs when incurred. The costs of fulfilling a contract with a customer are deferred and recorded as an asset if they generate or enhance resources for us that will be used in satisfying future performance obligations and are expected to be recovered. Installation costs related to residential and SMB customers that are not capitalized as part of the initial deployment of new customer premise equipment are expensed as incurred pursuant to industry-specific guidance. Deferred enterprise sales commission costs are included in other current and noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheet and totaled $ 18,109 and $ 17,511 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from residential and SMB customer contracts which are month-to month. As such, the amount of revenue related to unsatisfied performance obligations is not necessarily indicative of the future revenue to be recognized from our existing customer base. Contracts with enterprise customers generally range from three years to five years , and services may only be terminated in accordance with the contractual terms. [/1060]
[647]: We believe Adjusted EBITDA is an appropriate measure for evaluating our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures with similar titles are common performance measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry. Internally, we use revenue and Adjusted EBITDA measures as important indicators of our business performance and evaluate management’s effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides management and investors a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business and operating results by excluding items that are not comparable across reporting periods or that do not otherwise relate to our ongoing operating results. Adjusted EBITDA should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), and other measures of performance presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). Since Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with similar titles used by other companies. [/647]
[684]: Business services and wholesale revenue decreased $7,120 for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was due to lower SMB revenue and lower backhaul revenue attributable to wholesale customers, partially offset by a net increase in revenue of our Lightpath business primarily due to increases in Ethernet and indefeasible right of use contract fee revenue, partially offset by contract termination fee revenue. [/684]
[685]: News and Advertising Revenue [/685]
[686]: News and advertising revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $447,742 and $520,293, respectively. News and advertising revenue is primarily derived from the sale of (i) advertising inventory available on the programming carried on our cable television systems, as well as other systems (linear revenue), (ii) digital advertising, (iii) data analytics, and (iv) affiliation fees for news programming. [/686]
[687]: News and advertising revenue decreased $72,551 (14%) for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in linear advertising revenue from political customers. [/687]

Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis as Level 1 assets,
classified by security type as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 consisted of the following (in thousands): [/358]

[364]: The Company recognizes revenue
in accordance with ASC 606. The amount of revenue that the Company recognizes reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange
for goods or services and such revenue is recognized at the time when goods or services are transferred and/or delivered to its customers.
Revenue is recognized when the Company satisfies a performance obligation by transferring the product or service to the customer, either
at a point in time or over time. The Company usually recognizes revenue from integration service agreements and from manufacturing licenses
at a point in time unless the agreements provide for customer acceptance in which case revenue is recognized over time. Revenue from integration
license agreements and from MSTcad licenses are recognized over a period of time. [/364]
[349]: The Company follows authoritative
guidance which requires the evaluation of existing tax positions. Management has analyzed all open tax years, as defined by the statute
of limitations, for all major jurisdictions, which includes both federal and states where the Company has operations. Open tax years are
those that are open for examination by taxing authorities. [/349]

[353]: Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires
the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Significant estimates are used when accounting for the fair value of stock-based compensation,
borrowing rates used for lease accounting and valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. [/353]
[365]: The following table provides information about
disaggregated revenue by primary geographical markets and timing of revenue recognition for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022
(in thousands): [/365]
[367]: Unbilled contracts receivable and deferred revenue : [/367]
[368]: Timing of revenue recognition
may differ from the timing of invoicing customers. Accounts receivable includes amounts billed and currently due from customers. Unbilled
contracts receivable represents unbilled amounts expected to be received from customers in future periods, where the revenue recognized
to date exceeds the amount billed, and the right to receive payment is subject to the underlying contractual terms. Unbilled contracts
receivable amounts may not exceed their net realizable value and are classified as long-term assets if the payments are expected to be
received more than one year from the reporting date. [/368]
[370]: Basic net loss per share is
calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net loss per share is
computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the sum of the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding and the dilutive common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period. The Company’s potentially dilutive common
stock equivalent shares, which include incremental common shares issuable upon (i) the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants
and (ii) vesting of restricted stock units and restricted stock awards, are only included in the calculation of diluted net loss per share
when their effect is dilutive. Since the Company has had net losses for all periods presented, all potentially dilutive securities are
anti-dilutive. Accordingly, basic and diluted net loss per share are equal. [/370]
[335]: Property and Equipment Items capitalized as property
and equipment are stated at cost. Maintenance and routine repairs are charged to operations when incurred, while betterments and renewals
are capitalized. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective
assets starting when the asset is placed in service. [/335]
[336]: Revenue [/336]
[337]: The Company generates revenue
from integration engineering services, which it delivers either pursuant to integration license agreements or delivery of engineering
services and from the grant of manufacturing licenses to customers to use its technology in the manufacture of semiconductor wafers and/or
devices for the customer’s internal use. Revenue is recognized based on the following steps: (i) identification of the contract,
or contracts, with a customer, (ii) identification of the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determination of the transaction
price, (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations of the contract, and (v) recognition of revenue when, or
as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation. The Company’s integration services generally consist of depositing its proprietary
technology onto the customer’s semiconductor wafers and delivering such wafers back to the customer. Revenue from integration services
is recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied, which is upon transfer of control of the wafers to the customer (generally
upon shipment). Revenue from manufacturing licenses is recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied, which is generally upon
delivery of the Company’s MST recipe to the customer but is recognized over time if the performance obligation related to the grant
of the license includes customer acceptance. [/337]

[319]: Table element - Text before table: At December 31, 2023, the
Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $ 19.5 million and working capital of approximately $ 16.6 million . The Company has generated only limited revenues since inception and has incurred recurring operating losses. Accordingly, it
is subject to all the risks inherent in the initial organization, financing, expenditures, and scaling of a new business that is not generating
positive cashflow.
On May 31, 2022, Atomera
entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement with Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. and Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, as agents, under
which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time at its sole discretion, shares of its $0.001 par value common stock, in
“at the market” offerings to or through the agent as its sales agent, having aggregate offering proceeds of up to $50.0
million (the “ATM Facility”). During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company sold approximately 1.8 million shares pursuant to the ATM at an average price per share of approximately $ 7.97 ,
resulting in approximately $ 13.5 million of net proceeds to the Company after deducting commissions and other offering expenses.
Based on the funds it has
available as of the date of the filing of this report, the Company believes that it has sufficient capital to fund its current business
plans and obligations over, at least, 12 months from the date that these financial statements have been issued. The Company’s future
capital requirements and the adequacy of its available funds will depend on many factors, including the Company’s ability to successfully
commercialize its technology, competing technological and market developments, and the need to enter into collaborations with other companies
or acquire technologies to enhance or complement its current offerings. The Company’s operating plans for the next 12 months include
increased research and development expenses.; table: (row 0)

 [/319]
[231]: Revenue for the years ended
December 31, 2023 and 2022 was approximately $550,000 and $382,000, respectively. Our revenue for 2023 consisted of revenue from a manufacturing
license. Our revenue for 2022 consisted of a success fee pursuant to our JDA, a license fee paid under an integration license agreement
and MSTcad license revenue. [/231]
[232]: Cost of Revenue. Cost
of revenue consists of costs of materials, as well as direct compensation and expenses incurred to provide integration engineering services,
support for customer installation and qualification and MSTcad support. Cost of revenue was approximately $28,000 and $81,000 for the
years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We anticipate that our cost of revenue will vary substantially depending on the
mix of license and engineering services revenues we receive and the nature of products and/or services delivered in each customer engagement. [/232]
[233]: Operating Expenses. Operating expenses consist of research and development, general and administrative, and selling and marketing expenses. For the
years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 our operating expenses totaled approximately $21.2 million and $17.8 million, respectively. [/233]

[548]: The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the quantitative goodwill impairment assessment is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the reporting unit; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to the revenue growth rate, EBITDA margin, and weighted average cost of capital rate used in the income approach; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. [/548]
[549]: Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s goodwill impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the reporting unit. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate of the reporting unit; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the income approach; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the income approach; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to the revenue growth rate, EBITDA margin, and weighted average cost of capital rate. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to the revenue growth rate and EBITDA margin involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting unit; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the income approach and (ii) the reasonableness of the weighted average cost of capital rate assumption.

[497]: Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (Dollars in thousands, unless otherwise noted) [/497]
[498]: The Company’s significant accounting policies are more fully described in ""Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Management believes that the application of these [/498]
[499]: 38 [/499]
[500]: policies on a consistent basis enables the Company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the Company’s operating results and financial condition. [/500]
[501]: The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require management to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and that affect the reported amounts, including, but not limited to, inventory valuations, impairment of goodwill, stock-based compensation, long-term employee benefit obligations, income taxes and environmental matters. Management’s estimates are based on historical experience, facts and circumstances available at the time and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. The Company reviews these matters and reflects changes in estimates as appropriate. Management believes that the following represent some of the more critical judgment areas in the applications of the Company’s accounting policies which could have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. [/501]
[617]: The Company’s revenues by geographic area, and related approximate percentage of total sales for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows: [/617]
[619]: Deferred Income and Customer Advances [/619]
[620]: The Company defers revenues when cash payments are received in advance of our performance. Customer advances relate primarily to sales from the ammonium sulfate business. Below is a roll-forward of Deferred income and customer advances for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023: [/620]
[621]: 55 [/621]
[623]: The Company expects to recognize as revenue the December 31, 2023 ending balance of Deferred income and customer advances within one year or less. [/623]
[624]: Note 4. Income Taxes [/624]
[626]: Income taxes [/626]
[627]: Income tax expense (benefit) consists of: [/627]
[629]: The U.S. federal statutory income tax rate is reconciled to the effective income tax rate as follows: [/629]
[631]: The Company's effective income tax rate for 2023 approximated the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 21%. Increases to the effective income tax rate due primarily to state taxes and executive compensation limitations, were materially offset by research tax credits, excess tax benefits of equity compensation and the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. [/631]
[598]: Inventories – Substantially all of the Company's inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method. The Company includes spare and other parts in inventory which are used in support of production or production facilities operations and are valued based on weighted average cost. [/598]
[599]: Inventories valued at LIFO amounted to $ 195.6 million and $ 202.9 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Had such LIFO inventories been valued at current costs, their carrying values would have been approximately $ 95.2 million and $ 64.8 million higher at December 31, 2023 and 2022. Inventories valued at FIFO amounted to $ 16.2 million and $ 12.6 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. [/599]
[600]: Property, Plant, Equipment – Property, plant, equipment asset values are recorded at cost, including any asset retirement obligations, less accumulated depreciation. For financial reporting, the straight-line method of depreciation is used over the estimated useful lives of 10 to 40 years for buildings and improvements and 3 to 35 years for machinery and equipment. Our machinery and equipment includes (1) assets used in short production cycles or subject to high corrosion, such as instrumentation, controls and insulation systems with useful lives of 3 to 30 years, (2) standard plant assets, such as boilers and railcars, with useful lives ranging from 3 to 30 years and (3) major process equipment that can be used for long durations with effective preventative maintenance and repair, such as cooling towers, compressors, tanks and turbines with useful lives ranging from 3 to 35 years. Recognition of the fair value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets is required when there is a legal obligation to incur such costs. Upon initial recognition of a liability, the cost is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the corresponding asset’s useful life. [/600]
[535]: In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. [/535]
[536]: Basis for Opinions [/536]
[537]: The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. [/537]
[791]: Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting [/791]
[792]: The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of Company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. [/792]
[407]: Cost of Goods Sold [/407]
[409]: 2023 compared with 2022 [/409]
[410]: Costs of goods sold decreased in 2023 compared to 2022 by $262.6 million (approximately 16%) due primarily to decreased prices of raw materials including natural gas, sulfur, benzene and propylene (inputs to cumene which is a key feedstock to our products) (approximately 17%) partially offset by the impact of the U.S. Amines acquisition (approximately 1%). [/410]
[411]: 31 [/411]
[412]: Gross margin percentage decreased by approximately 5% in 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to the net impact of lower market pricing and formula-based raw material pass-through pricing (approximately 5%). [/412]
[413]: Selling, General and Administrative Expenses [/413]
[415]: 2023 compared with 2022 [/415]
[416]: Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in 2023 compared to 2022 by $7.8 million, or approximately 9%, due primarily to increased functional support costs including upgrades to our enterprise resource planning system, costs associated with pursuing the business interruption insurance claim in connection with the June 2019 shutdown of cumene supplier, Philadelphia Energy Solutions, and a cash recovery in 2022 of a previously written off receivable. These increases were partially offset by lower incentive-based compensation costs. [/416]
[778]: Note 20. Other Non-operating (Income) Expense, Net [/778]
[779]: For the year ended December 31, 2023, Other non-operating (income) expense, net primarily includes a pre-tax gain of approximately $ 11.4 million related to the Company's exit from the Oben alliance, the unfavorable impact to pre-tax income of approximately $ 4.5 million associated with a licensee of certain legacy ammonium sulfate fertilizer technology assets closing its facility and the unfavorable impact to pre-tax income of approximately $ 2.4 million from the exit of certain low-margin oximes products. [/779]
[780]: 74 [/780]
[781]: Note 21. Subsequent Events [/781]
[782]: As announced on February 16, 2024, the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $ 0.160 per share on the Company's common stock, payable on March 18, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 4, 2024. [/782]

[506]: Finite-Lived Intangible Assets – Other intangible assets with determinable lives consist of customer relationships, trademarks, patents and other intangibles and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 5 to 20 years. As described in ""Note 18. Acquisitions"" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, in February 2022, the Company acquired U.S. Amines Limited (""U.S. Amines"") for a purchase price of approximately $97 million, net of cash acquired. The acquisition [/506]
[507]: 39 [/507]
[508]: included intangible assets of $34 million consisting primarily of customer relationships, which reflects the value of the benefit derived from incremental revenue and related cash flows that are a direct result of the customer relationships in the amount of approximately $33 million. The fair value for the customer relationships intangible asset was determined by management using the multi-period excess earnings method. Management applied significant judgments and assumptions in determining the fair value of the customer relationships including gross margin rates, the discount rate, and customer attrition rate. [/508]
[768]: The estimated aggregate amortization expense for each of the next five years is as follows: [/768]
[770]: Note 18. Acquisitions [/770]
[771]: In February 2022, the Company acquired the stock of U.S. Amines, a leading North American producer of alkyl and specialty amines serving high-value end markets such as agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals for a purchase price of approximately $ 97.5 million, net of cash acquired. U.S. Amines employs approximately 50 people in the United States at manufacturing facilities in Bucks, AL and Portsmouth, VA. In accordance with ASC 805, this transaction has been accounted for as a business combination. The Company used its best estimates and assumptions for items including, but not limited to, corporate name recognition, strong, long-lasting customer relationships and potential revenue growth from existing customers to assign fair value to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date based on the information that was available as of the acquisition date. The transaction resulted in the Company acquiring tangible assets and finite-lived intangible assets, comprised of customer relationships (approximately $ 33 million) and trademarks (approximately $ 1 million) which reflect the value of the benefit derived from incremental revenue and related cash flows as a direct result of the customer relationships and name brand. These intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 20 years and 5 years, respectively. The residual amount of the purchase price in excess of the value of the tangible and definite-lived intangible assets was allocated to goodwill. Factors considered when identifying goodwill included, but are not limited to, a complementary business model and formula pricing mechanisms with a business that is adjacent to our ammonium sulfate adjuvant and solvent businesses, the enhancement of the Company’s value chain through internal supply of products and raw materials, a new unique platform in the agrochemicals space as well as a number of opportunities to support further penetration into high-value applications. The U.S. Amines acquisition was not significant to our Consolidated Financial Statements, therefore, pro forma and post-acquisition results of operations have not been presented. The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price consideration as of the acquisition date for the transaction noted above: [/771]
[509]: Revenue Recognition – The Company recognizes revenue upon the transfer of control of goods or services to customers at amounts that reflect the consideration expected to be received. AdvanSix primarily recognizes revenues when title and control of the product transfers from the Company to the customer.

[510]: Sales of our products to customers are made under a purchase order, and in certain cases in accordance with the terms of a master services agreement. These agreements typically contain formula-based pass-through pricing tied to key feedstock materials and volume ranges, but often do not specify the goods, including the quantities thereof, to be transferred. Certain master services agreements (including with respect to our largest customer) may contain minimum purchase volumes which can be satisfied by the customer on a periodic basis by choosing from various products offered by the Company. In these cases, a performance obligation is created when a customer submits a purchase order for a specific product at a specified price, typically providing for delivery within the next 60 days. Management considers the performance obligation with respect to such purchase order satisfied at the point in time when control of the product is transferred to the customer, which is indicated by shipment of the product and transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer. Transfer of control to the customer occurs through various modes of shipment, including trucks, railcars, and vessels, and follows a variety of commercially acceptable shipping or destination point terms pursuant to the arrangement with the customer. Variable consideration is estimated for future volume rebates and early pay discounts on certain products and product returns. The Company records variable consideration as an adjustment to the sale transaction price. Since variable consideration is generally settled within one year, the time value of money is not significant. [/510]

Earnings Per Share – Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and all dilutive potential common shares outstanding. Treasury Stock – The Company has elected to account for treasury stock purchased under the constructive retirement method. For shares repurchased in excess of par, the Company will allocate the excess value to additional paid-in capital. Use of Estimates – The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures in the accompanying Notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates and assumptions are periodically reviewed and the effects of changes are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the period they are determined to be necessary. Reclassifications – Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current period presentation. All reclassified amounts have been immaterial. Recent Accounting Pronouncements – The Company considers the applicability and impact of all Accounting Standards Updates (“ASUs”) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). ASUs not discussed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. On December 13, 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The amendments in this ASU require that public business entities, on an annual basis, disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that are equal to or greater than 5 percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income (or loss) by the applicable statutory income tax rate. The amendments also require that the Company disclose the following (net of refunds received): (1) the amount of income taxes paid disaggregated by federal (national), state, and foreign taxes and (2) the amount of income taxes paid disaggregated by individual jurisdictions in which income taxes paid is equal to or greater than 5 percent of total income taxes paid. Additionally, the amendments in this update eliminate the requirement for all entities to disclose the nature and estimate of the range of the reasonably possible change in the unrecognized tax benefits balance in the next 12 months or to make a statement that an estimate of the range cannot be made, and remove the requirement to disclose the cumulative amount of each type of temporary difference when a deferred tax liability is not recognized because of the exceptions to comprehensive recognition of deferred taxes related to subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures. The guidance is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption of the amendments in this update are permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued. The Company is evaluating the pronouncement and does not expect adoption to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations. In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280). The amendments in this ASU require incremental disclosures about the Company's reportable segments, but do not change the definition of a segment or the guidance for determining reportable segments. The incremental disclosures should include (1) significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the CODM and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, (2) an amount for other segment items by reportable segment and a description of its composition, (3) profit or loss and assets currently required by Topic 280 in interim periods, (4) clarification if the CODM uses more than one measure of a segment’s profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources and (5) the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The guidance is effective for public entities with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. Additionally, public entities should apply the amendments retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements, unless impractical. The Company is evaluating the pronouncement and does not expect adoption to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations. In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations. The amendments in this ASU require that a buyer in a supplier finance program disclose sufficient quantitative and qualitative information about its supplier finance programs to allow a user of the financial statements to understand the program’s nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period and potential magnitude. On a retrospective basis, for each annual reporting period, an entity should disclose the key terms of the program, including a description of the payment terms, assets pledged as security or other forms of guarantees, the confirmed amount outstanding that remains unpaid, a description of where the obligations are presented in the balance sheet and a roll-forward of those obligations confirmed as well as the amount of [/608]

[940]: Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates [/940]
[941]: Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. Management bases its assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results may differ from these assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. [/941]

As a result of foreign currency fluctuations, the U.S. Dollar equivalent values of our foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities change. Gains and losses on these contracts are included in other income (expense), on a net basis, along with the foreign currency gains and losses of the related foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities associated with these foreign currency forward contracts.

Cross-currency Interest Rate Swaps. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we elected to de-designate a portion of our cross-currency interest rate swaps previously designated as net investment hedges. Gains and losses subsequent to the de-designation will be recognized in earnings to offset remeasurement gains and losses from foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities. We also entered into $ 283.4 million of cross-currency interest rate swaps, which were not designated as hedging instruments.

[1199]: (1) The net change in our allowance for credit losses was insignificant during the year ended December 31, 2023. [/1199]
[1200]: The difference between the opening and closing balances of our accounts receivable, net, contract assets and deferred revenues primarily results from revenue growth and the timing difference between the satisfaction of our performance obligation and the customer's payment during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. The amounts of revenue recognized during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 from the opening deferred revenue balance were $ 95.1 million, $ 82.8 million and $ 93.1 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, no impairment loss related to contract balances was recognized in the consolidated statement of operations. [/1200]

We acquired MainOne and its assets for a total purchase consideration of $ 278.4 million. The MainOne Acquisition supports our ongoing expansion to meet customer demand in the West African market. [/1213]
[1214]: Purchase Price Allocation [/1214]
[1215]: Each of the acquisitions noted above constitute a business under the accounting standard for business combinations and, therefore, were accounted for as business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. Under this method, the total purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed measured at fair value on the date of acquisition, except where alternative measurement is required under GAAP. [/1215]
[1216]: During the year ended December 31, 2023, we completed the detailed valuation analysis and the final allocation of purchase price for the Entel Chile, Entel Peru, and MainOne Acquisitions. [/1216]
[1085]: In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. [/1085]
[1086]: Basis for Opinions [/1086]
[1087]: The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company's consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

[881]: In presenting AFFO, we exclude certain items that we believe are not good indicators of our current or future operating performance. AFFO represents FFO excluding depreciation and amortization expense on non-real estate assets, accretion, stock-based compensation, stock-based charitable contributions, restructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction costs, an installation revenue adjustment, a straight-line rent expense adjustment, a contract cost adjustment, amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums, gain (loss) on debt extinguishment, an income tax expense adjustment, recurring capital expenditures, net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, and adjustments from FFO to AFFO for unconsolidated joint ventures' and noncontrolling interests' share of these items. The adjustments for installation revenue, straight-line rent expense and contract costs are intended to isolate the cash activity included within the straight-lined or amortized results in the consolidated statement of operations. We exclude the amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums as these expenses relate to the initial costs incurred in connection with debt financings that have no current or future cash obligations. We exclude gain (loss) on debt extinguishment since it generally represents the write-off of initial costs incurred in connection with debt financings or a cost that is incurred to reduce future interest costs and is not a good indicator of our current or future operating performance. We include an income tax expense adjustment, which represents the non-cash tax impact due to changes in valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions and deferred taxes that do not relate to the current period's operations. We deduct recurring capital expenditures, which represent expenditures to extend the useful life of IBX data centers or other assets that are required to support current revenues. We also exclude net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, which represents results that may not recur and are not a good indicator of our current or future operating performance.

[384]: *Does not foot due to rounding [/384]
[385]: Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Expenses . Costs such as salaries, wages, employee benefits, rent, utilities, communications, insurance, fuel and taxes (other than state and federal income taxes) that are necessary to operate our service center and corporate operations are included in SG&A. Our SG&A expenses were $503 million (14.7% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $470 million (14.0% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2022. The $33 million increase in SG&A was driven by higher employee-related costs. [/385]
[386]: Operating Income . Operating income was $187 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $140 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $47 million due to the modest increase in revenue and higher gross profit margins. [/386]

 [/500]
[379]: Gross Profit . Our gross profit was $690 million (20.2% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $610 million (18.1% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2022. The $80 million increase was primarily attributable to the impact of our last-in first-out (""LIFO"") inventory costing methodology. As compared to average cost, our LIFO inventory costing methodology increased cost of sales by $2 million in 2023 compared to a $66 million increase in cost of sales in 2022. [/379]
[380]: Adjusted Gross Profit . Adjusted Gross Profit increased to $732 million (21.5% of sales) for 2023 from $715 million (21.3% of sales) for 2022, an increase of $17 million. The increase was primarily due to improved margins on gas products and valves, automation, measurement and instrumentation sales, along with specific high-margin line pipe sales. Adjusted Gross Profit is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted Gross Profit as sales, less cost of sales, plus depreciation and amortization, plus amortization of intangibles, plus inventory-related charges incremental to normal operations and plus or minus the impact of our LIFO inventory costing methodology. We present Adjusted Gross Profit because we believe it is a useful indicator of our operating performance without regard to items, such as amortization of intangibles that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon the nature and extent of acquisitions. Similarly, the impact of the LIFO inventory costing method can cause results to vary substantially from company to company depending upon whether they elect to utilize LIFO and depending upon which method they may elect. We use Adjusted Gross Profit as a key performance indicator in managing our business. We believe that gross profit is the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles that is most directly comparable to Adjusted Gross Profit. [/380]

[606]: Basis of Presentation : The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of MRC Global Inc. and its wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the “Company” or by such terms as “we,” “our” or “us”). All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. [/606]
[607]: Use of Estimates : The preparation of financial statements in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. We believe that our most significant estimates and assumptions are associated with the last-in, first -out (“LIFO”) inventory costing methodology, estimating net realizable value on excess and obsolete inventories, goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, realizability of deferred taxes and self-insurance programs. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. [/607]
[187]: Table element - Text before table: We may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions.
From time to time, we may selectively pursue acquisitions, including large scale acquisitions, to continue to grow and increase profitability. However, acquisitions, particularly of a significant scale, involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including intense competition for suitable acquisition targets, the potential unavailability of financial resources necessary to consummate acquisitions in the future, increased leverage due to additional debt financing that may be required to complete an acquisition, dilution of our stockholders’ net current book value per share if we issue additional equity securities to finance an acquisition, difficulties in identifying suitable acquisition targets or in completing any transactions identified on sufficiently favorable terms, assumption of undisclosed or unknown liabilities and the need to obtain regulatory or other governmental approvals that may be necessary to complete acquisitions. In addition, any future acquisitions may entail significant transaction costs and risks associated with entry into new markets.
Even when acquisitions are completed, integration of acquired entities can involve significant difficulties, such as:; table: (row 0) 
 (col 0): failure to achieve cost savings or other financial or operating objectives with respect to an acquisition; (row end);
 (row 1) 
 (col 0): strain on the operational and managerial controls and procedures of our business, and the need to modify systems or to add management resources; (row end);
 (row 2) 
 (col 0): difficulties in the integration and retention of customers, suppliers or personnel and the integration and effective deployment of operations or technologies; (row end);
 (row 3) 
 (col 0): amortization of acquired assets, which would reduce future reported earnings; (row end);
 (row 4) 
 (col 0): possible adverse short-term effects on our cash flows or operating results; (row end);
 (row 5) 
 (col 0): diversion of management’s attention from the ongoing operations of our business; (row end);
 (row 6) 
 (col 0): integrating personnel with diverse backgrounds and organizational cultures; (row end);
 (row 7) 
 (col 0): coordinating sales and marketing functions; (row end);
 [/187]
[623]: Cost of Sales : Cost of sales includes the cost of inventory sold and related items, such as vendor rebates, inventory allowances and reserves, shipping and handling costs associated with inbound and outbound freight, as well as depreciation and amortization and amortization of intangible assets. Certain purchasing costs and warehousing activities (including receiving, inspection and stocking costs), as well as general warehousing expenses, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses and not in cost of sales. [/623]
[624]: Earnings per Share : Basic earnings per share are computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, excluding any dilutive effects of unexercised stock options, unvested restricted stock awards, unvested restricted stock unit awards, unvested performance share unit awards, and shares of preferred stock. Diluted earnings per share are computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding including any dilutive effect of unexercised stock options, unvested restricted stock awards, unvested restricted stock unit awards, unvested performance share unit awards, and shares of preferred stock. The dilutive effect of unexercised stock options is calculated under the treasury stock method. Equity awards and shares of preferred stock are disregarded in the calculations of diluted earnings per share if they are determined to be anti-dilutive. [/624]

[399]: Table element - Text before table: We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides investors a helpful measure for comparing our operating performance with the performance of other companies that may have different financing and capital structures or tax rates. We believe it is a useful indicator of our operating performance without regard to items, such as amortization of intangibles, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon the nature and extent of acquisitions. Similarly, the impact of the LIFO inventory costing method can cause results to vary substantially from company to company depending upon whether they elect to utilize LIFO and depending upon which method they may elect. We use Adjusted EBITDA as a key performance indicator in managing our business. We believe that net income is the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles that is most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA.

The Company is subject to U.K. corporate taxation.  Due to the nature of its business, the Company has generated losses since inception and therefore not paid U.K. corporation tax. The provision for (benefit [/1573]
[1574]: F-44 [/1574]
[1575]: Table of Contents from) income taxes included in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss represents the tax impact from operating activities in the United States, which has generated taxable income based on intercompany service arrangements. Deferred tax assets benefitted in the United States do not have a valuation allowance against them because of profits that will be generated by an intercompany service agreement. ​ Starting in 2022, amendments to Section 174 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“IRC”), eliminated the option to immediately deduct research and development expenditures in the tax year that such costs are incurred. In accordance with the amendments, beginning on January 1, 2022, and continuing until the end of the second quarter of 2023, these research and development costs were capitalized by the Company and amortized over either a five- or 15-year period, depending on the location of the activities performed. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company completed an assessment, inclusive of an external tax analysis, and concluded that it is not required to capitalize certain research and development expenses incurred by its U.S. subsidiary associated with contractual research services performed on behalf of its U.K. subsidiary pursuant to an intercompany service arrangement because its U.S. subsidiary does not retain any ownership or rights in the underlying intellectual property resulting from the research services. The change in estimate upon the completion of this analysis resulted in the recognition of an income tax provision of $ 2.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company's income tax benefit recognized during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is mainly the result of deferred tax assets benefitted in the U.S. that do not have a valuation allowance against them because of profits that will be generated by an intercompany service agreement. The Company regularly assesses its ability to realize its deferred tax assets. Assessing the realization of deferred tax assets requires significant judgment. In determining whether its deferred tax assets are more likely than not realizable, the Company evaluated all available positive and negative evidence, and weighed the evidence based on its objectivity. After consideration of the evidence, including the Company's history of cumulative net losses in the U.K., the Company has concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefits of its U.K. deferred tax assets and accordingly the Company has provided a valuation allowance for the full amount of the net deferred tax assets in the U.K. The Company has considered its history of cumulative net profits in the United States and estimated future taxable income and has concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of its United States deferred tax assets and has not provided a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets in the United States. The valuation allowance increased in the year ended December 31, 2023 by $ 26.5 million due to the corresponding increase in U.K. deferred tax assets, primarily due to operating loss carryforwards generated during the year that were not surrendered for research credit utilization. The Company recorded a valuation allowance against all of its U.K. deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Company intends to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on its U.K. deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. The release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and an increase to the benefit for income taxes for the period the release is recorded. However, the exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to change on the basis of the level of profitability that the Company is able to actually achieve. The provision for (benefit from) income taxes shown on the consolidated statements of operations differs from amounts that would result from applying the statutory tax rates to income before taxes primarily because of certain permanent expenses that were not deductible and U.K., U.S. federal and state research and development credits, as well as the application of valuation allowances against the U.K. deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $ 266.2 million of U.K. operating loss carryforwards that have an indefinite life. The Company recognizes, in its consolidated financial statements, the effect of a tax position when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination. The Company had no uncertain tax positions during the years ended of December 31, 2023 and 2022. There are no amounts of interest or penalties recognized in the consolidated statement of operations or accrued on the consolidated balance sheet for any period presented. The Company does not expect any material changes in these uncertain tax benefits within the next 12 months. F-45 [/1575]

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, costs and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. [/1174]

[301]: We do not expect to generate revenue or profitability that is necessary to finance our operations in the short term.  Since inception, we have incurred recurring losses, including net losses of $180.7 million, $112.7 million and $66.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $511.8 million. To date, we have not commercialized any products or generated any revenues from the sale of products, and absent the realization of sufficient revenues from product sales, we may never attain profitability in the future.  We have devoted substantially all of our financial resources and efforts to research and development, including preclinical studies and our clinical trials.  Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. Net losses and negative cash flows have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our shareholders’ equity and working capital. [/301]
[1031]: Table of Contents ITEM 7.       MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. You should read this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and consolidated results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements, related notes and other financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or this Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions, contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. Please also see the section titled “Forward-Looking Statements.” For the discussion of the financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, refer to “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations” and “—Liquidity and Capital Resources” included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, on February 28, 2023. Overview We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a novel class of medicines, which we refer to as Bicycle ® molecules, for diseases that are underserved by existing therapeutics. Bicycle molecules are fully synthetic short peptides constrained to form two loops which stabilize their structural geometry. This constraint facilitates target binding with high affinity and selectivity, making Bicycle molecules attractive candidates for drug development. Bicycle molecules are a unique therapeutic modality combining the pharmacology usually associated with a biologic with the manufacturing and pharmacokinetic, or PK, properties of a small molecule. The relatively large surface area presented by Bicycle molecules allows targets to be drugged that have historically been intractable to non-biological approaches. Bicycle molecules are excreted by the kidney rather than the liver and have shown no signs of immunogenicity to date, qualities which we believe explain the molecules’ favorable toxicological profile. We have a novel and proprietary phage display screening platform which we use to identify Bicycle molecules in an efficient manner. The platform initially displays linear peptides on the surface of engineered bacteriophages, or phages, before “on-phage” cyclization with a range of small molecule scaffolds which can confer differentiated physicochemical and structural properties. Our platform encodes quadrillions of potential Bicycle molecules which can be screened to identify molecules for optimization to potential product candidates. We have used this powerful screening technology to identify our current portfolio of candidates in oncology and intend to use it in conjunction with our collaborators to seek to develop additional future candidates across a range of other disease areas. Our product candidates, BT8009, BT5528, and BT1718, are each a Bicycle Toxin Conjugate, or BTC ® molecule. These Bicycle molecules are chemically attached to a toxin that when administered is cleaved from the Bicycle molecule and kills the tumor cells. We are evaluating BT8009, a BTC molecule targeting Nectin-4, in both an ongoing company-sponsored Phase I/II clinical trial and a Phase II/III registrational trial called Duravelo-2, and BT5528, a BTC molecule targeting Ephrin type A receptor 2, or EphA2, in a company-sponsored Phase I/II clinical trial. In addition, BT1718 is being developed to target tumors that express Membrane Type 1 matrix metalloproteinase, or MT1 MMP, and is being investigated for safety, tolerability and efficacy in a Phase I/IIa clinical trial sponsored and fully funded by the Cancer Research UK Centre for Drug Development, or Cancer Research UK. In addition, our other product candidates, BT7480 and BT7455, are each a Bicycle Tumor-Targeted Immune Cell Agonist ® , or Bicycle TICA ® molecule. A Bicycle TICA molecule links immune cell receptor binding Bicycle molecules to tumor antigen binding Bicycle molecules. We are evaluating BT7480, a Bicycle TICA molecule targeting Nectin-4 and agonizing CD137, in a company-sponsored Phase I/II clinical trial, and we are conducting IND-enabling studies for BT7455, an EphA2/CD137 Bicycle TICA molecule. Our discovery pipeline in oncology includes next-generation BTC molecules, Bicycle radionuclide conjugates, or BRC TM molecules, Bicycle based systemic immune cell agonists and Bicycle TICA molecules. 110 [/1031]

[1180]: Table of Contents After determining the transaction price, we allocate it to the identified performance obligations based on the estimated standalone selling prices. We must develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract. We utilize key assumptions to determine the standalone selling price, which may include other comparable transactions, pricing considered in negotiating the transaction, probabilities of technical and regulatory success and the estimated costs. Certain variable consideration is allocated specifically to one or more performance obligations in a contract when the terms of the variable consideration relate to the satisfaction of the performance obligation and the resulting amounts allocated to each performance obligation are consistent with the amounts we would expect to receive for each performance obligation. We then recognize as revenue in the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over time, and if over time, based on the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. The measure of progress, and thereby periods over which revenue should be recognized, are subject to estimates by management and may change over the course of an arrangement. Licenses of Intellectual Property: If a license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other promises or performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenue from the portion of the transaction price that is allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license. For licenses that are combined with other promises, such as research and development services and a research license, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. Research and Development Services: The promises under our collaboration agreements may include research and development services to be performed by us on behalf of the partner. Payments or reimbursements resulting from our research and development efforts are recognized as the services are performed and presented on a gross basis because we are the principal for such efforts. Customer Options: A customer’s rights to choose, at its discretion, to make a payment for additional goods or services is generally considered an option. If we are not presently obligated to provide, and do not have a right to consideration for delivering additional goods or services, the item is considered an option. We evaluate customer options to obtain additional items (i.e., additional license rights) for material rights, or options to acquire additional goods or services for free or at a discount. Optional future goods and services that reflect their standalone selling prices do not provide the customer with a material right and, therefore, are not considered performance obligations and are accounted for as separate contracts. If optional future goods and services reflect a significant or incremental discount, they are material rights, and are accounted for as performance obligations. We allocate the transaction price to material rights based on the relative standalone selling price, which is determined based on the identified discount and the probability that the customer will exercise the option. Amounts allocated to a material right are not recognized as revenue until, at the earliest, the option is exercised or expires. Milestone Payments: Our collaboration agreements may include development and regulatory milestones. We evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimate the amounts to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial, and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the particular milestone in making this assessment. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within our control or the licensee’s control, such as marketing approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. At the end of each reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of such milestones and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjusts the estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect collaboration revenue and net loss in the period of adjustment. Milestone payments that may only be achieved after the exercise of a customer option are excluded from the initial determination of the transaction price. 126 [/1180]

[327]: Our ability to become and remain profitable depends on our ability to generate revenue. Generating product revenue will depend on our or any of our collaborators’ ability to obtain marketing approval for, and successfully commercialize, one or more of our product candidates. Successful commercialization will require achievement of key milestones, including completing clinical trials of our product candidates, obtaining marketing approval for these product candidates, manufacturing, marketing and selling those products for which we, or any of our collaborators, may obtain marketing approval, satisfying any post-marketing requirements and obtaining reimbursement for our products from private insurance or government payors. Because of the uncertainties and risks associated with these activities, we are unable to accurately predict the timing and amount of revenues, and if or when we might achieve profitability. We and any collaborators may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, or any collaborators do, we may never generate revenues that are large enough for us to achieve profitability. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. [/327]

The Company received no distributions and therefore recognized no net gains (losses) during the year ended December 31, 2022. [/1055]
[1056]: The Company's ownership interests in its affiliates were as follows: [/1056]
[1058]: (1) Non-VIE investments. [/1058]
[1059]: (2) During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company received distributions resulting from the sale of the underlying assets of the affiliate. [/1059]

[1066]: Other assets consisted of the following: [/1066]
[989]: As presented in Note 20, the Corporate & Other segment revenue amounts were $ 110.9 million, $ 108.9 million, and $ 45.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, which are presented in other revenues and owned hotels revenues in the consolidated statements of income.

[997]: Notes Receivable [/997]
[998]: The Company has provided financing in the form of notes receivable loans to franchisees to support the development of hotel properties in strategic markets. The Company's credit quality indicator is the level of security in the note receivable. [/998]
[683]: Results of Operations - Royalty, licensing and management fees, operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share (""EPS"") represent the key measures of our financial performance. These measures are primarily driven by the operations of our hotel franchise system and, therefore, our analysis of the Company's operations is primarily focused on the size, performance, and the potential growth of the hotel franchise system as well as our variable overhead costs. [/683]
[684]: Our discussion of our results of operations excludes reimbursable franchise marketing and reservation system revenues and expenses and the management agreement cost reimbursements and expenses included in the Company's other revenues from franchised and managed properties and other expenses from franchised and managed properties. The Company's franchise agreements require the payment of marketing and reservation system fees to be used by the Company for the expenses associated with providing franchise services such as national marketing, media advertising, and central reservation systems. The Company is obligated to expend the marketing and reservation system fees it collects from its franchisees in accordance with the franchise agreements. Furthermore, the franchisees are required to reimburse the Company for any deficits generated by these marketing and reservation system activities. Over time, the Company expects the cumulative revenues and expenses of reimbursable components to break even and, therefore, no income or loss will be generated from the reimbursable marketing and reservation system activities. Additionally, the legacy Radisson Hotels Americas management agreements include cost reimbursements, primarily related to payroll costs at managed hotels where the Company is the employer. As a result, the Company generally excludes the other revenues and other expenses from franchised and managed properties from the analysis of its operations. [/684]

During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the Company recognized losses totaling $ 3.4 million, $ 3.7 million, and $ 18.9 million, respectively, from these investment that represent VIEs. The Company's maximum exposure to losses related to its investments in the VIEs is limited to the total of its respective equity investment as well as certain limited payment guaranties, which are described in Note 23 of these consolidated financial statements. [/1053]
[1054]: The Company recognized no impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2023. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized impairment charges of $ 0.2 million and $ 19.3 million, respectively, related to certain equity method investments. The Company estimated the fair value of each investment on an individual basis and derived the fair value from a combination of observable prices from offers received for either the underlying collateral or the ownership interest of the unconsolidated affiliate, comparable market transactions, and DCF techniques to project the cash flows for the investment based upon the underlying property. There are judgments and assumptions in each of these fair value determinations, including our selection of comparable market transactions, the amount and timing of the expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, and sales capitalization rates. These nonrecurring fair value measurements are classified as level three in the fair value measurement hierarchy, as the Company utilized unobservable inputs which are significant to the overall fair value. Based on these analyses, in each case the Company determined that the fair value declined below the carrying value and the decline is other-than-temporary. As a result, the Company recognized an impairment charge equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value for each investment. [/1054]

[1220]: 20. Reportable Segment Information [/1220]
[1221]: The Hotel Franchising & Management reportable segment includes the Company's hotel franchising operations which consists of its 22 brands and brand extensions and the hotel management operations of 14 hotels (inclusive of four owned hotels). The 22 brands and brand extensions and hotel management operations are aggregated together within this reportable segment because they have similar economic characteristics, types of customers, distribution channels, and regulatory business environments. The revenues from the hotel franchising and management business include royalty fees, initial franchise fees and relicensing fees, cost reimbursement revenues, platform and procurement services fees revenue, base and incentive management fees, and other hotel franchising and management-related revenue. The Company provides certain services under its franchise and management agreements which result in direct and indirect reimbursements. The cost reimbursement revenues received from the franchisees are included in Hotel Franchising & Management revenues and are offset by the related expenses in order to calculate Hotel Franchising & Management operating income. The equity in the earnings or losses from the hotel franchising-related investment in affiliates is allocated to the Hotel Franchising & Management reportable segment. The Company evaluates its Hotel Franchising & Management reportable segment based primarily on the results of the segment without allocating corporate expenses, indirect general and administrative expenses, interest expense, interest income, other gains and losses, or income taxes, all of which are included in the Corporate & Other column in the tables presented below. The Corporate & Other column additionally reflects the operations of the Company's owned hotels. Intersegment Eliminations to revenues is the elimination of Hotel Franchising & Management revenue which includes royalty fees, management and cost reimbursement fees charged to our owned hotels against the franchise and management fee expense that is recognized by our owned hotels in Corporate & Other operating income (loss).

[929]: NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS [/929]
[930]: 1. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies [/930]
[931]: Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Choice Hotels International, Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively, ""Choice"" or the ""Company"") have been prepared by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""GAAP"") pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. In the opinion of management, the accompanying consolidated financial statements include all adjustments that are necessary to fairly present the Company's financial position and results of operations. Except as otherwise disclosed, all adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. Certain prior year amounts in our consolidated financial statements have been reclassified in order to maintain comparability with the current year presentation. Business combination, diligence and transition costs, which were previously presented in selling, general and administrative expenses, are now presented within a standalone financial statement line item in the consolidated statements of income. The reclassification had no effect on the Company’s previously reported operating income or net income. Acquisition of Radisson Hotels Americas On August 11, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition (the ""Transaction"") of (1) all of the issued and outstanding shares of Radisson Hospitality, Inc., and (2) certain trademarks held by Radisson Hospitality Belgium BV/SRL (collectively referred to as ""Radisson Hotels Americas""). The Company determined that it was the accounting acquirer of Radisson Hotels Americas and accounted for the Transaction as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair values as of the August 11, 2022 acquisition date, with the exception of certain assets and liabilities which were accounted for in accordance with the provisions of ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (""ASU 2021-08""). The Company finalized the purchase price allocation for the Transaction during the third quarter of 2023. Refer to Note 24 for more information. Revenue Recognition Franchise Agreements The Company's revenues are primarily derived from franchise agreements with third-party hotel owners. The majority of the Company’s performance obligations are a series of distinct services, which are described in more detail below, for which the Company receives variable consideration through franchise fees. The Company enters into franchise agreements to provide franchisees with a limited non-exclusive license to utilize the Company’s registered brand tradenames and trademarks, marketing and reservation services, and other miscellaneous franchise services. These agreements typically have an initial term of 10 to 30 years with provisions permitting the franchisees or the Company to terminate the franchise agreement upon designated anniversaries of the hotel opening before the end of the initial term. An up-front initial franchise fee is assessed to the third-party hotel owners to affiliate with our brands, which is typically paid prior to the execution of the franchise agreement and is non-refundable. After hotel opening, franchise fees are typically generated based on a percentage of gross room revenues or as designated transactions and events occur (such as when a reservation is delivered to the hotel through a specified channel) and are invoiced by the Company in the following month. The franchise agreements are comprised of multiple performance obligations, which may require significant judgment in identifying. The primary performance obligations are as follows: • License of brand intellectual property and related services (“brand intellectual property”) - Grants the right to access the Company’s intellectual property associated with the brand tradenames, trademarks, reservation systems, property management systems, and related services. [/931]
[748]: Gain on Extinguishment of Debt [/748]
[749]: Gain on extinguishment of debt was $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company derecognized certain economic development loans from the consolidated balance sheets due to satisfying the relevant performance conditions in the loan agreements. [/749]
[750]: Other (Gain) Loss [/750]
[751]: The Company recognized other net gains of $10.6 million and other net losses of $7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the net gain was primarily due to a $6.6 million increase in the Company's deferred compensation assets based on increases in the fair value of the underlying investments and a $4.0 million unrealized gain on investments in equity securities. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the net loss was primarily due to a decrease in the Company's deferred compensation assets based on decreases in the fair value of the underlying investments. [/751]
[752]: Income Tax Expense [/752]
[753]: The Company's effective income tax rates were 23.3% and 24.0% for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were higher than the U.S. federal income tax rate of 21.0% primarily due to state income taxes and tax expense related to compensation, partially offset by federal income tax credits.

[966]: In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (""ASU 2023-09""). ASU 2023-09 is designed to provide additional information to financial statement users in regards to how an entity's operations, risks, and planning affect its tax rate, opportunities, and future cash flows. ASU 2023-09 is effective for the annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2024. Based on the Company's assessment, the adoption of this standard is not expected to have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements, but it will require enhanced income tax disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. [/966]
[967]: 2. Revenue [/967]
[968]: Contract Liabilities Contract liabilities relate to (i) advance consideration received related to services considered to be a part of the brand intellectual property performance obligation, such as initial franchise fees that are paid when a franchise agreement is executed and system implementation fees that are paid at the time of installation, and (ii) amounts received when loyalty points are issued but the associated revenue has not yet been recognized since the related loyalty points have not been redeemed. [/968]
[952]: As construction in progress and software development are completed and then placed in service, the assets are transferred to the appropriate property and equipment categories and depreciation and amortization begins. Upon the sale or the retirement of the property, the cost and the related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and any related gain or loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of income. Repairs and maintenance, and minor replacements, are charged to expense as incurred. [/952]

[404]: Table element - Text before table: Adjusted EBITDA is not presented in accordance with GAAP and has important limitations as an analytical tool. These measures should not be considered as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP. In addition, these measures are defined differently by different companies and, accordingly, such measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies. In addition to the factors listed above, share-based compensation expense is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. Although share-based compensation is a key incentive offered to certain employees, business performance is evaluated excluding share-based compensation expense. Depending upon the size, timing and the terms of grants, share-based compensation expense may vary but will recur in future periods.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, we did not enter into any swaps and, therefore, paid no upfront premiums for options.

[727]: (a) Adjusted pre-tax income (loss), adjusted net income (loss), EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are included as supplemental disclosures because we believe they are useful indicators of our operating performance. Derivations of pre-tax income (loss), net income and EBITDA are well-recognized performance measurements in the airline industry that are frequently used by our management, as well as by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in comparing the operating performance of companies in our industry. [/727]

[729]: Adjusted pre-tax income (loss), adjusted net income (loss), EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools. Some of the limitations applicable to these measures include: adjusted pre-tax income (loss), adjusted net income (loss), EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; adjusted pre-tax income (loss), adjusted net income (loss), EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our indebtedness or possible cash requirements related to our warrants; although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted pre-tax income (loss), adjusted net income (loss), EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, adjusted pre-tax income (loss), adjusted net income (loss), EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because derivations of adjusted pre-tax income (loss), adjusted net income (loss), EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not determined in accordance with GAAP, such measures are susceptible to varying calculations and not all companies calculate the measures in the same manner. As a result, derivations of pre-tax income (loss), net income (loss) and EBITDA, including adjusted pre-tax income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted EBITDA, as presented may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.

For the foregoing reasons, each of adjusted pre-tax income (loss), adjusted net income (loss), EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA has significant limitations which affect its use as an indicator of our profitability. Accordingly, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this information.
(b) EBITDAR and adjusted EBITDAR are included as a supplemental disclosure because we believe them to be useful solely as valuation metrics for airlines as their calculations isolate the effects of financing in general, the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions (primarily aircraft, which may be acquired directly, directly subject to acquisition debt, by capital lease or by operating lease, each of which is presented differently for accounting purposes), and income taxes, which may vary significantly between periods and for different airlines for reasons unrelated to the underlying value of a particular airline. However, EBITDAR and adjusted EBITDAR are not determined in accordance with GAAP, are susceptible to varying calculations and not all companies calculate the measure in the same manner. As a result, EBITDAR and adjusted EBITDAR, as presented, may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. In addition, EBITDAR and adjusted EBITDAR should not be viewed as a measure of overall performance since they exclude aircraft rent, which is a normal, recurring cash operating expense that is necessary to operate our business.

[725]: Table element - Text before table: Other Income (Expense). Other income (expense) was $35 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to no other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2022. Higher interest rates and increased balances in our interest-bearing cash accounts contributed to an increase in interest income. Additionally, higher interest rates and the increase in PDP balances contributed to greater capitalized interest. Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 due to increased rates and balances as compared to the prior period and interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was unfavorably impacted by a $7 million non-cash charge from the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the repayment of the Treasury Loan.
Income Taxes. Our income tax expense was $43 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to an $8 million benefit for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 134.4%, primarily due to a $37 million valuation allowance recorded in December 2023 against our U.S. federal and state net operating loss deferred tax assets, which expire from one year to having no expiration, as a result of being in a three-year cumulative pre-tax loss position and limitations on compensation provided to certain executives pursuant to Internal Revenue Code section 162(m), partially offset by benefits recognized on the exercise of expiring stock options. Please refer to “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—15. Income Taxes” for additional information.

[387]: SEGMENT RESULTS [/387]
[388]: The summary that follows provides a discussion of the results of operations of our three segments: North America Confectionery, North America Salty Snacks and International.  For segment reporting purposes, we use “segment income” to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources.  Segment income excludes unallocated general corporate administrative expenses, unallocated mark-to-market gains and losses on commodity derivatives, business realignment and impairment charges, acquisition-related costs and other unusual gains or losses that are not part of our measurement of segment performance.  These items of our operating income are largely managed centrally at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment income reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker and used for resource allocation and internal management reporting and performance evaluation.  Segment income and segment income margin, which are presented in the segment discussion that follows, are non-GAAP measures and do not purport to be alternatives to operating income as a measure of operating performance.  We believe that these measures are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors, as they exclude the activities that are not directly attributable to our ongoing segment operations. [/388]
[500]: Recent Accounting Pronouncements [/500]
[501]: Information on recently adopted and issued accounting standards is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. [/501]
[503]: CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES [/503]
[504]: The preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates and assumptions. We believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following: [/504]
[505]: • Accrued Liabilities for Trade Promotion Activities [/505]
[506]: • Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits Plans [/506]
[507]: • Business Acquisitions, Valuation and Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets [/507]
[508]: • Income Taxes [/508]
[509]: Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board.  While we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions.  Other significant accounting policies are outlined in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. [/509]
[695]: The purchase price allocation presented above has been finalized as of the third quarter of 2022 and includes an immaterial amount of measurement period adjustments.  The measurement period adjustments to the initial allocation were based on more detailed information obtained about the specific assets acquired and liabilities assumed, specifically, the refinement of certain assumptions in the value of customer relationships based on an analysis of [/695]
[697]: THE HERSHEY COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated) [/697]
[698]: historical customer-specific data and post-closing adjustments to the working capital acquired including certain holdbacks. [/698]
[699]: Goodwill was determined as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired (including the identifiable intangible assets).  The goodwill derived from this acquisition is deductible for tax purposes and reflects the value of leveraging our brand building expertise, supply chain capabilities and retail relationships to accelerate growth and access to the portfolio of Dot’s products. [/699]

[682]: 2. BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES [/682]
[683]: Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for as business combinations and, accordingly, the results of operations of the businesses acquired have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the respective dates of the acquisitions.  The purchase price for each acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In conjunction with acquisitions noted below, we used various valuation techniques to determine fair value of the assets acquired, with the primary techniques being discounted cash flow analysis, relief-from-royalty, a form of the multi-period excess earnings and the with-and-without valuation approaches, which use significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy.  Inputs to these valuation approaches require significant judgment including: (i) forecasted sales, growth rates and customer attrition rates, (ii) forecasted operating margins, (iii) royalty rates and discount rates used to present value future cash flows, (iv) the amount of synergies expected from the acquisition, (v) the economic useful life of assets and (vi) the evaluation of historical tax positions.  In certain acquisitions, historical data is limited; therefore, we base our estimates and assumptions on budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. 2023 Activity Manufacturing Capacity On May 31, 2023, we completed the acquisition of certain assets that provide additional manufacturing capacity from Weaver, a leader in the production and co-packing of microwave popcorn and ready-to-eat popcorn, and former co-manufacturer of the Company’s SkinnyPop brand.  The cash consideration paid for Weaver totaled $ 165,818 and consisted of cash on hand and short-term borrowings. Acquisition-related costs for the Weaver acquisition were immaterial. The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination and, accordingly, Weaver has been included within the North America Salty Snacks segment from the date of acquisition.  The purchase consideration was allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values and consisted of $ 85,231 to goodwill, $ 79,136 to property, plant and equipment, net and $ 1,451 to other net assets acquired.  The purchase price allocation  has been finalized as of the fourth quarter of 2023 and did not include measurement period adjustments. Goodwill was determined as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired.  The goodwill derived from this acquisition is deductible for tax purposes and reflects the value of leveraging our supply chain capabilities to accelerate growth and access to our portfolio of salty snacks products. 2021 Activity Pretzels Inc. On December 14, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Pretzels Inc. (“Pretzels”), previously a privately held company that manufactures and sells pretzels and other salty snacks for other branded products and private labels in the United States.  Pretzels is an industry leader in the pretzel category with a product portfolio that includes filled, gluten free and seasoned pretzels, as well as extruded snacks that complements Hershey’s snacks portfolio.  Based in Bluffton, Indiana, Pretzels operates three manufacturing locations in Indiana and Kansas.  Pretzels provides Hershey with deep pretzel category and product expertise and the manufacturing capabilities to support brand growth and future pretzel innovation.  The cash consideration paid for Pretzels totaled $ 304,334 and consisted of cash on hand and short-term borrowings.  Acquisition-related costs for the Pretzels acquisition were immaterial. [/683]
[787]: For real estate, equipment and vehicles that support selling, marketing and general administrative activities the Company accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.  These asset categories comprise the majority of our leases.  The lease and non-lease components of real estate and equipment leases supporting production activities are not accounted for as a single lease component.  Consideration for such contracts is allocated to the lease component and non-lease components based upon relative standalone prices either observable or estimated if observable prices are not readily available. [/787]
[788]: The components of lease expense were as follows: [/788]
[790]: (1) Supply chain-related amounts were included in cost of sales. [/790]
[791]: (2) Net lease cost does not include short-term leases, variable lease costs or sublease income, all of which are immaterial. [/791]

 (col 0): Description of the Matter (col 2): The unsettled portion of the Company’s obligation for trade promotion activities at December 31, 2023 was $194.0 million. As discussed in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company promotes its products through programs such as, but not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives, and volume-based incentives. The Company recognizes the estimated costs of these trade promotion activities as a component of variable consideration when determining the transaction price. The unsettled portion of the Company’s obligation for trade promotion activities is included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. Auditing management’s calculation of the unsettled portion of the Company’s obligation for trade promotion activities was subjective and required judgment as a result of the nature of the required estimates and assumptions. In particular, the estimates required an analysis of the programs offered, expectations regarding customer and consumer participation, and experience with historical payment patterns. (row end);
 (row 4) 
 (col 0): How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit (col 2): We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the controls related to the Company’s calculation of the accrued liabilities for trade promotion activities. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of the completeness of the promotional activities as well as the significant assumptions and the data inputs utilized in the calculations. To test the unsettled portion of the Company’s obligation for trade promotion activities, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing (1) the expected value estimation methodology used by management, (2) whether all material trade promotion activities were properly included in management’s estimate, and (3) the assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used in its analyses. Specifically, when evaluating the assumptions, we compared them to historical trends, third party data, and assumptions used in prior periods, and inspected management’s retrospective review of actual trade promotion activities compared to previous estimates. We also performed sensitivity analyses of assumptions to evaluate the changes in the estimate that would result from changes in the assumptions. (row end);
 [/609]
[532]: We determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets using an income approach. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows.  Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate the future cash flows used to measure fair value.  Our estimates of future cash flows consider past performance, current and anticipated market conditions and internal projections and operating plans which incorporate estimates for sales growth and profitability, and cash flows associated with taxes and capital spending.  Additional assumptions include forecasted growth rates, estimated discount rates, which may be risk-adjusted for the operating market of the reporting unit, and estimated royalty rates that would be charged for comparable branded licenses.  We believe such assumptions also reflect current and anticipated market conditions and are consistent with those that would be used by other marketplace participants for similar valuation purposes.  Such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions. [/532]

[664]: associated with these programs and incentives are based upon our analysis of the programs offered, expectations regarding customer and consumer participation, historical sales and payment trends, and our experience with payment patterns associated with similar programs offered in the past.  The estimated costs of these programs are reasonably likely to change in future periods due to changes in trends with regard to customer and consumer participation, particularly for new programs and for programs related to the introduction of new products.  Differences between estimated expense and actual program performance are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period and are normally not significant. During 2023, 2022 and 2021, actual promotional costs have not deviated from the estimated amount by more than 3 %. The Company’s unsettled portion remaining in accrued liabilities at year-end for these activities was $ 194,032 and $ 215,688 at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We also recognize a minor amount of royalty income (less than 1% of our consolidated net sales) from sales-based licensing arrangements, pursuant to which revenue is recognized as the third-party licensee sales occur.  Shipping and handling costs incurred to deliver product to the customer are recorded within cost of sales.  Sales, value add and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue producing activities are excluded from revenue. The majority of our products are confectionery or confectionery-based and, therefore, exhibit similar economic characteristics, as they are based on similar ingredients and are marketed and sold through the same channels to the same customers.  In connection with our recent acquisitions, we have expanded our portfolio of salty snacking products, which also exhibit similar economic characteristics to our confectionery products and are sold through the same channels to the same customers.  See Note 13 for revenues reported by geographic segment, which is consistent with how we organize and manage our operations, as well as product line net sales information. In 2023, 2022 and 2021, approximately 28 %, 28 % and 30 %, respectively, of our consolidated net sales were made to McLane Company, Inc., one of the largest wholesale distributors in the United States to convenience stores, drug stores, wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers and the primary distributor of our products to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Cost of Sales Cost of sales represents costs directly related to the manufacture and distribution of our products.  Primary costs include raw materials, packaging, direct labor, overhead, shipping and handling, warehousing and the depreciation of manufacturing, warehousing and distribution facilities.  Manufacturing overhead and related expenses include salaries, wages, employee benefits, utilities, maintenance and property taxes. Selling, Marketing and Administrative Expense Selling, marketing and administrative expense (“SM&A”) represents costs incurred in generating revenues and in managing our business.  Such costs include advertising and other marketing expenses, selling expenses, research and development costs, administrative and other indirect overhead costs, amortization of capitalized software and intangible assets and depreciation of administrative facilities. Research and development costs, charged to expense as incurred, totaled $ 50,030 in 2023, $ 46,943 in 2022 and $ 40,107 in 2021.  Advertising expense is also charged to expense as incurred and totaled $ 604,853 in 2023, $ 517,677 in 2022 and $ 511,798 in 2021.  There was no prepaid advertising expense as of  December 31, 2023.  Prepaid advertising expense was $ 241 as of December 31, 2022. Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid debt instruments, time deposits and money market funds with original maturities of three months or less.  The fair value of cash equivalents approximates the carrying amount. Accounts Receivable—Trade In the normal course of business, we extend credit to customers that satisfy pre-defined credit criteria, based upon the results of our recurring financial account reviews and our evaluation of current and projected economic conditions.  Our primary concentration of credit risk is associated with McLane Company, Inc., one customer served principally by our North America Confectionery segment.  As of December 31, 2023, McLane Company, Inc. accounted for approximately 24 % of our total accounts receivable.  No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our year-end accounts receivable.  We believe that we have little concentration of credit risk associated with the remainder of our customer base.  Accounts receivable-trade in the Consolidated Balance Sheets is presented net of allowances for bad debts and anticipated discounts of $ 31,663 and $ 26,001 at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

[758]: Income Statement Impact of Derivative Instruments [/758]
[759]: The effect of derivative instruments on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was as follows: [/759]
[761]: (a) Gains (losses) recognized in income for non-designated commodities futures and options contracts were included in cost of sales.  Gains (losses) recognized in income for non-designated foreign currency forward exchange contracts and deferred compensation derivatives were included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses. [/761]
[762]: (b) Gains (losses) reclassified from AOCI into income for foreign currency forward exchange contracts were included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses.  Losses reclassified from AOCI into income for interest rate swap agreements were included in interest expense. [/762]
[763]: The amount of pretax net losses on derivative instruments, including interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency forward exchange contracts expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months was approximately $ 9,659 as of December 31, 2023.  This amount is primarily associated with interest rate swap agreements. [/763]

[670]: required.  For those reporting units tested using a quantitative approach, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill.  If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, impairment is indicated, requiring recognition of a goodwill impairment charge for the differential (up to the carrying value of goodwill).  We test individual indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the estimated fair values with the book values of each asset. We determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets using an income approach.  Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows.  Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate the future cash flows used to measure fair value.  Our estimates of future cash flows consider past performance, current and anticipated market conditions and internal projections and operating plans which incorporate estimates for sales growth and profitability, and cash flows associated with taxes and capital spending.  Additional assumptions include forecasted growth rates, estimated discount rates, which may be risk-adjusted for the operating market of the reporting unit, and estimated royalty rates that would be charged for comparable branded licenses.  We believe such assumptions also reflect current and anticipated market conditions and are consistent with those that would be used by other marketplace participants for similar valuation purposes. Such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions. The cost of intangible assets with finite useful lives is amortized on a straight-line basis.  Our finite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of certain trademarks, customer-related intangible assets and patents obtained through business acquisitions. The weighted-average amortization period for our finite-lived intangible assets is approximately 28 years, which is primarily driven by recently acquired trademarks.  If certain events or changes in operating conditions indicate that the carrying value of these assets, or related asset groups, may not be recoverable"

[431]: The components of the change in Flow net sales were as follows: [/431]
[433]: The 5.4 percent increase in net sales for Flow in 2023 from 2022 was primarily the result of: [/433]
[434]: • increased selling prices to mitigate inflationary cost increases; [/434]
[435]: • increased sales volume in our commercial and industrial solutions businesses in 2023 compared to the prior year; and [/435]
[778]: Restructuring and transformation-related costs included within Cost of goods sold and Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income included the following: [/778]

[721]: The $ 26.8 million increase in net contract assets from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023 was primarily the result of timing of milestone payments. Approximately 90 % of our contract liabilities at December 31, 2022 were recognized in revenue during the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. There were no impairment losses recognized on our net contract assets for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, there were $ 1.1 million of impairment losses recognized on our net contract liabilities as a result of our exit of business activity and sales in Russia. [/721]
[722]: Practical expedients and exemptions [/722]
[723]: We generally expense incremental costs of obtaining a contract when incurred because the amortization period would be less than one year. These costs primarily relate to sales commissions and are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. [/723]

[754]: Restricted share awards and units (“RSUs”) are recorded as compensation cost over the requisite service periods based on the market value on the date of grant. Performance share units (“PSUs”) are stock awards where the ultimate number of shares issued will be contingent on the Company’s performance against certain performance goals. The Compensation Committee has the ability to adjust performance goals or modify the manner of measuring or evaluating a performance goal using its discretion. The fair value of each PSU is based on the market value on the date of grant. We recognize expense related to the estimated vesting of our PSUs granted. The estimated vesting of the PSUs is based on the probability of achieving certain performance metrics over the specified performance period. Earnings per ordinary share We present two calculations of earnings per ordinary share (“EPS”). Basic EPS equals net income divided by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income by the sum of weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding plus dilutive effects of ordinary share equivalents, calculated using the two-class method. Derivative financial instruments We recognize all derivatives, including those embedded in other contracts, as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the derivative is designated and effective, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”) as a separate component of equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income when the hedged item affects earnings. If the underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist or if the hedge becomes ineffective, all changes in fair value of the related derivatives that have not been settled are recognized in current earnings. For a derivative that is not designated as or does not qualify as a hedge, changes in fair value are reported in earnings immediately. We use derivative instruments for the purpose of hedging interest rate and currency exposures, which exist as part of ongoing business operations. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Our policy is not to enter into contracts with terms that cannot be designated as normal purchases or sales. From time to time, we may enter into short duration foreign currency contracts to hedge foreign currency risks. Foreign currency translation The financial statements of the Company’s non-U.S. dollar functional currency international subsidiaries are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date. Income (loss) and expense items are translated at average monthly rates of exchange. The resultant translation adjustments are included in AOCI, a component of equity. New accounting standards In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting”, which expands annual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures regarding significant expenses. We plan to adopt the standard retrospectively beginning with our annual reporting for the year ending December 31, 2024 and interim reporting beginning January 1, 2025. We are currently evaluating the potential effect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, “Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures”, which requires new and enhanced disclosures primarily related to income taxes paid and the effective tax rate reconciliation. We will adopt the standard beginning with our annual reporting for the year ending December 31, 2025. We are currently evaluating the potential effect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures. [/754]

[549]: Cost of Sales and Operating Expenses: [/549]
[550]: The tables below reflect our operating results on both a GAAP and constant currency basis. Amounts included in the discussions that follow each table are provided in constant currency and are inclusive of costs related to our acquisitions. The impact of foreign exchange translation is discussed separately, where material. [/550]
[552]: Software Licenses: The increase in the cost of software licenses was primarily due to increased third-party royalties of $7.1 million. [/552]
[553]: Amortization: The increase in amortization expense was primarily due to the amortization of newly acquired intangible assets. [/553]
[554]: Maintenance and Service: The net increase in maintenance and service costs was primarily due to the following: [/554]
[555]: • Increased stock-based compensation of $3.3 million. [/555]
[556]: • Decreased salaries of $1.2 million. [/556]
[557]: The improvement in gross profit was a result of the increase in revenue. [/557]

[538]: Year Ended December 31, 2023 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2022 [/538]
[539]: Revenue: [/539]
[541]: Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased 9.9% compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, or 10.2% in constant currency. Maintenance revenue growth of 9.9%, or 10.3% in constant currency, is correlated with the license sales discussed later in this paragraph and is driven substantially by our existing customer base. The reported $99.3 million growth in maintenance revenue was attributable to a $95.8 million increase in maintenance associated with lease licenses and a $3.5 million increase in maintenance associated with perpetual sales. Subscription lease license revenue increased 14.3%, or 14.4% in constant currency, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, with substantially all of the increase attributable to additional sales to our existing customers. The reported $98.4 million increase in lease license revenue was attributable to a $83.8 million increase in value from multi-year licenses and a $14.6 million increase in value from annual licenses. [/541]
[607]: Expenses related to business combinations. We incur expenses for professional services rendered in connection with business combinations, which are included in our GAAP presentation of selling, general and administrative expense. We also incur other expenses directly related to business combinations, including compensation expenses and concurrent restructuring activities, such as employee severances and other exit costs. These costs are included in our GAAP presentation of selling, general and administrative and research and development expenses. We exclude these acquisition-related expenses for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance, as we generally would not have otherwise incurred these expenses in the periods presented as a part of our operations. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate our operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by us to review our operating results, and (b) review historical comparability in our financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors’ operating results. [/607]
[43]: Note About Forward-Looking Statements [/43]
[44]: The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to contract revenue, standalone selling prices of our products and services, allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, useful lives for depreciation and amortization, acquired deferred revenue, operating lease assets and liabilities, fair value of stock awards, deferred compensation, income taxes, uncertain tax positions, tax valuation reserves, and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience, market experience, estimated future cash flows and various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. [/44]
[909]: Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2023, we completed other acquisitions to expand our solution offerings and enhance our customers' experience. These acquisitions were not significant, individually or in the aggregate. The combined purchase price of these acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2023 was approximately $ 94.4 million, or $ 88.3 million net of cash acquired. [/909]
[910]: During the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred acquisition-related expenses of $ 9.4 million. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized as selling, general and administrative and research and development expenses on the consolidated statements of income. [/910]
[911]: The assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisitions have been recorded based upon management's estimates of their fair market values as of each respective date of acquisition. The following tables summarize the fair value of consideration and the fair values of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed at each respective date of acquisition: [/911]
[611]: Table element - Text before table: Non-GAAP tax provision. We utilize a normalized non-GAAP annual effective tax rate (AETR) to calculate non-GAAP measures. This methodology provides better consistency across interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of non-recurring items and aligning the non-GAAP tax rate with our expected geographic earnings mix. To project this rate, we analyzed our historic and projected non-GAAP earnings mix by geography along with other factors such as our current tax structure, recurring tax credits and incentives, and expected tax positions. On an annual basis we re-evaluate and update this rate for significant items that may materially affect our projections.
Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
We have provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as listed below:; table: (row 0)

[491]: The 2023 period non-GAAP results exclude the income statement effects of stock-based compensation, excess payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, expenses related to business combinations and adjustments for the income tax effect of the excluded items. The 2022 period non-GAAP results also exclude the income statement effects of acquisition accounting adjustments to deferred revenue from business combinations closed prior to 2022. This adjustment is not material in 2023. [/491]
[492]: Our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 reflected the following variances: [/492]
[494]: Our results reflect an increase in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2023 due to growth in subscription lease license, maintenance and service revenue. We also experienced increased operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to increased personnel costs. The actual U.S. Dollar reported results were impacted by a stronger U.S. Dollar. [/494]

[606]: Stock-based compensation expense . We incur expense related to stock-based compensation included in our GAAP presentation of cost of maintenance and service; research and development expense; and selling, general and administrative expense. This non-GAAP adjustment also includes excess payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation. Although stock-based compensation is an expense and viewed as a form of compensation, we exclude these expenses for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance. Specifically, we exclude stock-based compensation during our annual budgeting process and our quarterly and annual assessments of our performance. The annual budgeting process is the primary mechanism whereby we allocate resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. Additionally, the annual review by our Board of Directors during which it compares our historical business model and profitability to the planned business model and profitability for the forthcoming year excludes the impact of stock-based compensation. In evaluating the performance of our senior management and department managers, charges related to stock-based compensation are excluded from expenditure and profitability results. In fact, we record stock-based compensation expense into a stand-alone cost center for which no single operational manager is responsible or accountable. In this way, we can review, on a period-to-period basis, each manager’s performance and assess financial discipline over operational expenditures without the effect of stock-based compensation. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate our operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by us to review our operating results, and (b) review historical comparability in our financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors’ operating results. [/606]
[682]: If actual results are materially different than the assumptions we used to determine fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed through a business combination, it is possible that adjustments to the carrying values of such assets and liabilities will have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding our business acquisitions. [/682]
[683]: Income Taxes [/683]
[684]: Description [/684]
[685]: Our income tax expense reflects management's best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid. We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period of the enactment date. [/685]
[783]: • We evaluated the estimated economic life of the Company’s software through observable data points. [/783]
[784]: • Through our current and historical audit procedures, we confirmed that the term software license portion and PCS portion of an arrangement are not sold separately from one another. [/784]
[785]: • We selected a sample of arrangements and performed the following: [/785]
[786]: – Compared the list price of the subscription lease license to the consideration received from the customer and recalculated the discount from list price for each arrangement. [/786]
[787]: – Evaluated whether management appropriately calculated the estimated standalone selling price for the subscription lease license. [/787]
[788]: – Tested management’s identification of distinct performance obligations. [/788]
[789]: – Tested the mathematical accuracy of revenue recognized at a point in time or over time based upon the identification of subscription lease licenses within the arrangement. [/789]

- The results of operations table in fragment 399 confirms these same total revenue numbers for 2023 and 2022.
- The tables specify the numbers are in millions of USD.
- The column headers indicate the numbers are for the years ended December 31, implying a 12 month duration each year.

[613]: LNG and natural gas inventory are recorded at the lower of weighted average cost and net realizable value.  Materials and other inventory are recorded at the lower of cost and net realizable value.  Inventory is charged to expense when sold, or, for certain qualifying costs, capitalized to property, plant and equipment when issued, primarily using the weighted average method. [/613]
[614]: Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost.  Expenditures for construction and commissioning activities, major renewals and betterments that extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized, while expenditures for maintenance and repairs (including those for planned major maintenance projects) to maintain property, plant and equipment in operating condition are generally expensed as incurred.

[399]: Table element - Text before table: The market dynamics brought on by the need to displace and replace Russian gas into Europe in 2023 resulted in a notable uptick in long-term LNG contracting and a push for LNG project FIDs.  Commercial activity in 2023 continued to build on last year’s momentum with executed long-term SPAs in the U.S. reaching approximately 23 mtpa for the year, of which Cheniere’s SPAs and IPM agreements totaled approximately 6.5 mtpa.  This contractual momentum over the past two years led to the positive FID of nearly 40 mtpa of U.S. LNG capacity in 2023.
Despite the global impacts of the Russia-Ukraine war, we do not believe we have significant exposure to adverse direct or indirect impacts of the war, as we do not conduct business in Russia and refrain from business dealings with Russian entities.  Additionally, we are not aware of any specific adverse direct or indirect effects of the Russia-Ukraine war or the Israel-Hamas war on our supply chain.  Consequently, we believe we are well positioned to help meet the increased demand of our international LNG customers to overcome their supply shortages.

[443]: Table element - Text before table: The following discussion of our future sources and uses of liquidity includes estimates that reflect management’s assumptions and currently known market conditions and other factors as of December 31, 2023.  Estimates are not guarantees of future performance and actual results may differ materially as a result of a variety of factors described in this annual report on Form 10-K.
Future Sources of Liquidity under Executed SPAs
As described in Items 1. and 2. Bu siness and Properties , our long-term customer arrangements form the foundation of our business and provide us with significant, stable, long-term cash flows.  Substantially all of our future revenues are contracted under SPAs and because many of these contracts have long-term durations, we are contractually entitled to significant future consideration under these contracts which has not yet been recognized as revenue.  This future consideration is in most cases, not yet legally due to us and was not reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023.  In addition, a significant portion of this future consideration is subject to variability as discussed more specifically below.  We anticipate that this consideration will be available to meet liquidity needs in the future.

[852]: NOTE 1. BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES [/852]
[853]: Business —Danaher Corporation (“Danaher” or the “Company”) designs, manufactures and markets professional, medical and industrial products and services, which are typically characterized by strong brand names, innovative technology and major market positions.  As of December 31, 2023, the Company operates in three business segments: • The Biotechnology segment includes the bioprocessing and discovery and medical businesses and offers a broad range of equipment, consumables and services that are primarily used by customers to advance and accelerate the research, development, manufacture and delivery of biological medicines.  The biotherapeutics that the Company’s solutions support range from replacement therapies such as insulin, vaccines, recombinant proteins and other biologic drugs, to novel cell, gene, mRNA and other nucleic acid therapies. • The Life Sciences segment offers a broad range of instruments, consumables, services and software that are primarily used by customers to study genomics and the basic building blocks of life, including DNA and RNA, nucleic acid, proteins, metabolites and cells, in order to understand the causes of disease, identify new therapies, and test and manufacture new drugs, vaccines and gene editing technologies.  Additionally, the segment provides products and consumables used to filter and remove contaminants from a variety of liquids and gases in many end-market applications. • The Diagnostics segment offers clinical instruments, consumables, software and services that hospitals, physicians’ offices, reference laboratories and other critical care settings use to diagnose disease and make treatment decisions. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for a discussion of significant acquisitions and discontinued operations, including the disposal of the Company’s former Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Accounting Principles —The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).  The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.  All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.  The Consolidated Financial Statements also reflect the impact of noncontrolling interests.  Noncontrolling interests do not have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated results of continuing operations, therefore earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests for continuing operations are not presented separately in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests have been reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses and were insignificant in all periods presented.  Reclassifications of certain prior year amounts have been made to conform to the current year presentation. Use of Estimates —The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  The Company bases these estimates on historical experience, the current economic environment and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.  However, uncertainties associated with these estimates exist and actual results may differ materially from these estimates. Cash and Equivalents —The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Accounts Receivable and Allowances for Doubtful Accounts —All trade accounts, contract and finance receivables are reported on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets adjusted for any write-offs and net of allowances for doubtful accounts.  The allowances for doubtful accounts represent management’s best estimate of the expected future credit losses from the Company’s trade accounts, contract and finance receivable portfolios.  Determination of the allowances requires management to exercise judgment about the timing, frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the provision for credit losses and, therefore, net earnings.  The Company regularly performs detailed reviews of its portfolios to determine if an impairment has occurred and evaluates the collectability of receivables based on a combination of various financial and qualitative factors that may affect customers’ ability to pay, including customers’ financial condition, collateral, debt-servicing ability, past payment experience and credit bureau information.  In circumstances where the Company is aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations, a specific reserve is recorded against amounts due to reduce the recognized receivable to the amount reasonably expected to be collected.  Additions to the allowances for doubtful accounts are charged to current period earnings, amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged directly against the allowances, while amounts recovered on previously written-off accounts increase the allowances.  If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional reserves would be required.  The Company does not believe that trade accounts receivable represents significant concentrations of credit risk because of the diversified portfolio of [/853]
[931]: NOTE 6. SEGMENT INFORMATION [/931]
[932]: In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company realigned its reportable segments to reflect changes in the Company’s internal organization resulting from the rate of growth within certain of the Company’s businesses in the former Life Sciences segment.  There was no change to the Company’s Diagnostics segment.  Prior period segment amounts have been restated to conform to the revised segment presentation. [/932]
[933]: The Company operates and reports its results in three separate business segments consisting of the Biotechnology, Life Sciences and Diagnostics segments.  Operating profit represents total revenues less operating expenses, excluding nonoperating income and expense, loss on early extinguishment of borrowings, interest and income taxes.  Operating profit amounts in the Other segment consist of unallocated corporate costs and other costs not considered part of management’s evaluation of reportable segment operating performance.  The identifiable assets by segment are those used in each segment’s operations.  Intersegment amounts are not significant and are eliminated to arrive at consolidated totals. [/933]

[701]: Amortization expense primarily relates to the amortization of intangible assets and inventory fair value adjustments.  Depreciation expense relates to both the Company’s manufacturing and operating facilities as well as instrumentation leased to customers under operating-type lease (“OTL”) arrangements.  Depreciation, amortization and stock compensation are noncash expenses that decrease earnings without a corresponding impact to operating cash flows.  Unrealized investment gains/losses impact net earnings from continuing operations without immediately impacting cash flows as the cash flow impact from investments occurs when the invested capital is returned to the Company. [/701]
[735]: Contractual and Other Obligations [/735]
[736]: For a description of the Company’s debt and lease obligations, commitments, and litigation and contingencies, refer to Notes 10, 14, 17 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. [/736]
[737]: Legal Proceedings [/737]
[738]: Refer to Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding legal proceedings and contingencies, and for a discussion of risks related to legal proceedings and contingencies, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” [/738]
[739]: CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES [/739]
[740]: Management’s discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  The Company bases these estimates and judgments on historical experience, the current economic environment and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Actual results may differ materially from these estimates and judgments. [/740]
[602]: Operating Profit Performance [/602]
[603]: Operating profit margins declined 660 basis points during 2023 as compared to 2022.  The following factors impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons. [/603]
[604]: 2023 vs. 2022 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by: [/604]
[605]: • Lower 2023 core sales, the impact of product mix and reduced leverage in the segment’s operational and administrative cost structure - 635 basis points [/605]
[606]: • 2023 impairment charge related to a technology-based intangible asset - 25 basis points [/606]
[607]: • The incremental dilutive effect in 2023 of acquired businesses, net of product line dispositions which did not qualify as discontinued operations - 5 basis points [/607]
[608]: 2023 vs. 2022 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by: [/608]
[609]: • 2022 impairments of accounts receivable as well as accruals for contractual obligations in Russia - 5 basis points [/609]
[610]: Depreciation and amortization of intangible assets increased as a percentage of sales during 2023 as compared with 2022, primarily as a result of the decrease in sales. [/610]
[507]: • sales from acquired businesses (as defined below, as applicable); and [/507]
[508]: • the impact of currency translation. [/508]
[509]: References to sales or operating profit attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to sales or operating profit, as applicable, from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition less any sales and operating profit, during the applicable period, attributable to divested product lines not considered discontinued operations.  The portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between: [/509]
[510]: • the period-to-period change in revenue (as defined above, as applicable); and [/510]
[511]: • the period-to-period change in revenue (as defined above, as applicable) after applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period. [/511]
[512]: Core sales (decline) growth should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, sales, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.  Management believes that reporting these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in Danaher’s business and facilitating comparisons of Danaher’s revenue performance with its performance in prior and future periods and to Danaher’s peers.  Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures to measure the Company’s operating and financial performance and uses core sales (decline) growth as one of the performance measures in the Company’s executive short-term cash incentive program.  The Company excludes the effect of currency translation from these measures because currency translation is not under management’s control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends, and excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestiture-related items because the nature, size, timing and number of acquisitions and divestitures can vary dramatically from period-to-period and between the Company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult.

[481]: OVERVIEW [/481]
[482]: General [/482]
[483]: Refer to “Item 1. Business—General” for a discussion of Danaher’s strategic objectives and methodologies for delivering long-term shareholder value.  Danaher is a multinational business with global operations.  During 2023, approximately 60% of Danaher’s sales were derived from customers outside the United States.  As a diversified, global business, Danaher’s operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry-specific economic, political and geopolitical factors.  Danaher’s geographic and industry diversity, as well as the range of its products and services, help mitigate the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country, other than the United States, on its consolidated operating results.  The Company’s individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including to the extent possible their sales, to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future. [/483]

[597]: Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Implementation of New Financial Accounting Standards [/597]
[598]: Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include Eli Lilly and Company and all subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). We consider majority voting interests, as well as effective economic or other control over an entity when deciding whether or not to consolidate an entity. We generally do not have control by means other than voting interests. Where our ownership of consolidated subsidiaries is less than 100 percent, the noncontrolling shareholders' interests are reflected as a separate component of equity. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We issued our financial statements by filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and have evaluated subsequent events up to the time of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We operate as a single operating segment engaged in the discovery, development, manufacturing, marketing, and sales of pharmaceutical products worldwide. A global research and development organization and a supply chain organization are responsible for the discovery, development, manufacturing, and supply of our products. Regional commercial organizations market, distribute, and sell the products. The business is also supported by global corporate staff functions. Our determination that we operate as a single segment is consistent with the financial information regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker for purposes of evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets, and planning and forecasting for future periods. Research and Development Expenses and Acquired In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D) Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs consist of expenses incurred in performing research and development activities, including but not limited to, compensation and benefits, facilities and overhead expense, clinical trial expense and fees paid to contract research organizations. Acquired IPR&D includes the initial costs and development milestones incurred related to externally developed IPR&D projects, acquired directly in a transaction other than a business combination, that do not have an alternative future use. Development milestones are milestone payment obligations that are incurred prior to regulatory approval of the compound and are expensed when the event triggering an obligation to pay the milestone occurs. Earnings Per Share (EPS) All per-share amounts, unless otherwise noted in the footnotes, are presented on a diluted basis. We calculate basic EPS based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus the effect of incremental shares from potential participating securities. We calculate diluted EPS based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus the effect of incremental shares from our stock-based compensation programs. [/598]

[969]: To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Eli Lilly and Company [/969]
[970]: Opinion on the Financial Statements [/970]
[971]: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Eli Lilly and Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ""consolidated financial statements""). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. [/971]
[972]: We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 21, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. [/972]
[601]: Note 2: Revenue [/601]
[602]: The following table summarizes our revenue recognized in our consolidated statements of operations: [/602]
[604]: (1) Collaboration and other revenue associated with prior period transfers of intellectual property was $ 191.6 million, $ 163.4 million, and $ 175.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. [/604]
[605]: 63 [/605]
[606]: We recognize revenue primarily from two different types of contracts, product sales to customers (net product revenue) and collaborations and other arrangements. Revenue recognized from collaborations and other arrangements includes our share of profits from the collaborations, as well as royalties, upfront and milestone payments we receive under these types of contracts. See Note 4 for additional information related to our collaborations and other arrangements. Collaboration and other revenue disclosed above includes the revenue from the Jardiance ® and Trajenta ® families of products resulting from our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, as well as from the sales of rights for the olanzapine portfolio, including Zyprexa ® , and for Baqsimi ® , all of which are discussed in Note 4. Substantially all of the remainder of collaboration and other revenue is related to contracts accounted for as contracts with customers. Net Product Revenue Revenue from sales of products is recognized at the point where the customer obtains control of the goods and we satisfy our performance obligation, which generally is at the time we ship the product to the customer. Payment terms differ by jurisdiction and customer, but payment terms in most of our major jurisdictions typically range from 30 to 70 days from date of shipment. Revenue for our product sales has not been adjusted for the effects of a financing component as we expect, at contract inception, that the period between when we transfer control of the product and when we receive payment will be one year or less. Any exceptions are either not material or we collect interest for payments made after the due date. Provisions for rebates, discounts, and returns are established in the same period the related product sales are recognized. We generally ship product shortly after orders are received; therefore, we generally only have a few days of orders received but not yet shipped at the end of any reporting period. Shipping and handling activities are considered to be fulfillment activities and are not considered to be a separate performance obligation. We exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are imposed on our sales of product and collected from a customer. Most of our products are sold to wholesalers that serve pharmacies, physicians and other healthcare professionals, and hospitals. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, our three largest wholesalers each accounted for between 16 percent and 21 percent of consolidated revenue. Further, they each accounted for between 18 percent and 29 percent of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Significant judgments must be made in determining the transaction price for our sales of products related to anticipated rebates, discounts, and returns. The following describe the most significant of these judgments: Sales Rebates and Discounts - Background and Uncertainties • We initially invoice our customers at contractual list prices. Contracts with direct and indirect customers may provide for various rebates and discounts that may differ in each contract. As a consequence, to determine the appropriate transaction price for our product sales at the time we recognize a sale to a direct customer, we estimate any rebates or discounts that ultimately will be due to the direct customer and other customers in the distribution chain under the terms of our contracts. Significant judgments are required in making these estimates. • The rebate and discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net product revenue. Sales rebates and discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, chargebacks, long-term care, hospital, patient assistance programs, and various other programs. We estimate these accruals using an expected value approach. • The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts include rebates associated with sales covered by managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, and chargeback programs, as well as reductions in revenue related to our patient assistance programs, in the U.S. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical rebate payments for these programs, as well as patient assistance program costs, by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends (e.g., patent expiries and product launches), an evaluation of the current contracts for these programs, the percentage of our products that are sold via these programs, and our product pricing. Although we accrue a liability for revenue reductions related to these programs at the time we record the sale, the reduction related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later. Because of this time lag, in any particular period our net product revenue may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods. [/606]

[603]: Table element - Text before table: Foreign Currency Translation Operations in our subsidiaries outside the United States (U.S.) are recorded in the functional currency of each subsidiary which is determined by a review of the environment where each subsidiary primarily generates and expends cash. The results of operations for our subsidiaries outside the U.S. are translated from functional currencies into U.S. dollars using the weighted-average currency rate for the period. Assets and liabilities are translated using the period end exchange rates. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from translating the net assets of these subsidiaries are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). Advertising Expenses Costs associated with advertising are expensed as incurred and are included in marketing, selling, and administrative expenses. Advertising expenses, comprised primarily of online marketing and television advertising, totaled $ 1.12 billion, $ 966.8 million, and $ 1.24 billion in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, which was less than 5 percent of revenue each year. Other Significant Accounting Policies Our other significant accounting policies are described in the remaining appropriate notes to the consolidated financial statements. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to conform with the current presentation. Development milestone payments related to externally developed IPR&D projects, acquired directly in a transaction other than a business combination, were previously included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows and are now included in purchases of IPR&D in cash flows from investing activities. The reclassification resulted in an increase to net cash provided by operating activities and net cash used in investing activities of $ 501.3 million and $ 105.2 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Implementation of New Financial Accounting Standards Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures , establishes incremental disaggregation of income tax disclosures pertaining to the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and requires prospective application with the option to apply it retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We intend to adopt this standard in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2025. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this standard on our disclosures. ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, requires disclosures about significant segment expenses and additional interim disclosure requirements. This standard also requires a single reportable segment to provide all disclosures required by ASC 280. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted, and the amendments should be applied retrospectively for all prior periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. We intend to adopt this standard in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this standard on our disclosures.

[438]: We evaluate our business segment operating performance using segment revenue and Segment EBITDA, as described in Note 5 “ Business segment reporting ” in our consolidated financial statements. We believe Segment EBITDA is a useful operating performance measure as it excludes non-cash charges and other transactions not related to our core operating activities and corporate costs, and Segment EBITDA allows management to more meaningfully analyze the trends and performance of our core operations by segment as well as to make decisions regarding the allocation of resources to our segments.

[667]: Research and development Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and relate to spending for new product development and innovation and includes internal engineering, materials and third -party costs. We incurred $ 11.4 million, $ 7.3 million and $ 6.7 million of research and development costs for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 , respectively, which are included in “Cost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization” in the consolidated statements of operations. [/667]
[668]: Earnings (loss) per share Basic earnings (loss) per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities to issue common stock were exercised or converted to common stock. [/668]

[550]: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Expro Group Holdings N.V. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

[636]: Basis of presentation The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the U.S. dollar (“$” or “USD”) as the reporting currency. [/636]
[637]: 60 Table of Contents EXPRO GROUP HOLDINGS N.V. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements [/637]
[638]: Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements reflect the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealized profits arising from them, have been eliminated for purposes of preparing these consolidated financial statements. Investments in which we do not have a controlling interest, but over which we do exercise significant influence, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. [/638]
[639]: Use of estimates Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Estimates and assumptions are used for, but are not limited to, determining the following: purchase price allocation on business combinations, valuation of intangible assets, expected credit losses, inventory valuation reserves, impairment assessment of goodwill, income tax provisions, recovery of deferred taxes, actuarial assumptions to determine costs and liabilities related to employee benefit plans and revenue recognition. While we believe that the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, actual results could differ from these estimates. [/639]

[502]: Critical accounting policies and estimates [/502]
[503]: The preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires Expro to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and associated costs as well as reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent liabilities. Certain accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties. We evaluate estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We consider the following policies to be the most critical to understanding the judgments that are involved and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. [/503]
[738]: The following table presents our capital expenditures disaggregated by our operating segments (in thousands): [/738]
[741]: Disaggregation of revenue [/741]
[742]: We disaggregate our revenue from contracts with customers by geography, as disclosed in Note 5 above, as we believe this best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. Additionally, we disaggregate our revenue into areas of capability. [/742]
[743]: The following table sets forth the total amount of revenue by areas of capability as follows (in thousands): [/743]
[745]: 75 Table of Contents EXPRO GROUP HOLDINGS N.V. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements [/745]
[746]: Contract balances [/746]
[747]: We perform our obligations under contracts with our customers by transferring services and products in exchange for consideration. The timing of our performance often differs from the timing of our customers’ payments, which results in the recognition of receivables and deferred revenue. [/747]
[748]: Unbilled receivables are initially recognized for revenue earned on completion of the performance obligation which are not yet invoiced to the customer. The amounts recognized as unbilled receivables are reclassified to trade receivable upon billing. Deferred revenue represents the Company’s obligations to transfer goods or services to customers for which the Company has received consideration, in full or part, from the customer. [/748]

Adjusted EBITDA margin reflects our Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues. [/405]
[406]: We define Adjusted Cash Flow from Operations as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities adjusted for cash paid during the period for interest, net, severance and other expense and merger and integration expense. We define Cash Conversion as Adjusted Cash Flow from Operations divided by Adjusted EBITDA. [/406]
[407]: Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Cash Flow from Operations and Cash Conversion have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. As Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Cash Flow from Operations and Cash Conversion may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Cash Flow from Operations and Cash Conversion may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.

[1299]: (2) Significant Accounting Policies (a) Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain reclassifications were made to the financial statements for the prior period to conform to current period presentation. The effect of these reclassifications had no impact on previously reported members’ equity or net income. (b) Management’s Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. (c) Revenue Recognition We generate the majority of our revenues from midstream energy services, including gathering, transmission, processing, fractionation, storage, condensate stabilization, brine services, and marketing, through various contractual arrangements, which include fee-based contract arrangements or arrangements where we purchase and resell commodities in connection with providing the related service and earn a net margin for our fee. While our transactions vary in form, the essential element of most of our transactions is the use of our assets to transport a product or provide a processed product to an end-user or marketer at the tailgate of the plant, pipeline, or barge, truck, or rail terminal. Revenues from both “Product sales” and “Midstream services” represent revenues from contracts with customers and are reflected on the consolidated statements of operations as follows: • Product sales— Product sales represent the sale of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, and condensate where the product is purchased and resold in connection with providing our midstream services as outlined above. • Midstream services— Midstream services represent all other revenue generated as a result of performing our midstream services outlined above. Evaluation of Our Contractual Performance Obligations Performance obligations in our contracts with customers include: • promises to perform midstream services for our customers over a specified contractual term and/or for a specified volume of commodities; and • promises to sell a specified volume of commodities to our customers. The identification of performance obligations under our contracts requires a contract-by-contract evaluation of when control, including the economic benefit, of commodities transfers to and from us (if at all). For contracts where control of commodities transfers to us before we perform our services, we generally have no performance obligation for our services, and accordingly, we do not consider these revenue-generating contracts. Based on the control determination, all contractually-stated fees that are deducted from our payments to producers or other suppliers for commodities purchased are reflected as a reduction in the cost of such commodity purchases. Alternatively, for contracts where control of commodities transfers to us after we perform our services, we consider these contracts to contain performance obligations for our services. Accordingly, we consider the satisfaction of these performance obligations as revenue-generating and recognize the fees received for satisfying them as midstream services revenues over time as we satisfy our performance obligations. For contracts where control of commodities never transfers to us and we simply earn a fee for our services, we recognize these fees as midstream services revenues over time as we satisfy our performance obligations. We also evaluate our contractual arrangements that contain a purchase and sale of commodities under the principal/agent provisions in ASC 606. For contracts where we possess control of the commodity and act as principal in the purchase and sale, [/1299]
[1317]: (g) Natural Gas, Natural Gas Liquids, Crude Oil, and Condensate Inventory [/1317]
[1318]: Our inventories of products consist of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, and condensate. We report these assets at the lower of cost or market value which is determined by using the weighted average cost method. [/1318]
[1319]: (h) Property and Equipment [/1319]
[1320]: Property and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Assets acquired in a business combination are recorded at fair value. Routine repairs and maintenance are charged against income when incurred. Renewals and improvements that extend the useful life or improve the function of the properties are capitalized. [/1320]
[1321]: The components of property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation are as follows (in millions): [/1321]

[1081]: ◦ Depreciation and amortization in the Corporate segment decreased $2.5 million primarily due to assets reaching the end of their depreciable lives. [/1081]
[1082]: Critical Accounting Policies [/1082]
[1083]: The selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as the accounting rules have developed. Accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives but involve an interpretation and implementation of existing rules and the use of judgment to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business. Compliance with the rules involves reducing a number of very subjective judgments to a quantifiable accounting entry or valuation. We make every effort to properly comply with all applicable rules on or before their adoption, and we believe the proper implementation and consistent application of the accounting rules is critical. [/1083]
[937]: The GAAP measure most directly comparable to free cash flow after distributions is net cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flow after distributions should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss), operating income (loss), net cash provided by operating activities, or any other measure of liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flow after distributions has important limitations because it excludes some items that affect net income (loss), operating income (loss), and net cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flow after distributions may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate this non-GAAP metric in the same manner. To compensate for these limitations, we believe that it is important to consider net cash provided by operating activities determined under GAAP, as well as free cash flow after distributions, to evaluate our overall liquidity.

[911]: Table element - Text before table: Adjusted Gross Margin
We define adjusted gross margin as revenues less cost of sales, exclusive of operating expenses and depreciation and amortization. We disclose adjusted gross margin in addition to gross margin as defined by GAAP because it is the primary performance measure used by our management to evaluate consolidated operations. We believe adjusted gross margin is an important measure because, in general, our business is to gather, process, transport, or market natural gas, NGLs, condensate, and crude oil for a fee or to purchase and resell natural gas, NGLs, condensate, and crude oil for a margin. Operating expense is a separate measure used by our management to evaluate the operating performance of field operations. Direct labor and supervision, property insurance, property taxes, repair and maintenance, utilities, and contract services comprise the most significant portion of our operating expenses. We exclude all operating expenses and depreciation and amortization from adjusted gross margin because these expenses are largely independent of the volumes we transport or process and fluctuate depending on the activities performed during a specific period. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to adjusted gross margin is gross margin. Adjusted gross margin should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, gross margin as determined in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted gross margin has important limitations because it excludes all operating expenses and depreciation and amortization that affect gross margin. Our adjusted gross margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other entities may not calculate these amounts in the same manner.

[994]: Analysis of Operating Segments [/994]
[995]: We manage and report our operations primarily according to the geography and the nature of the activity. We have five reportable segments: Permian segment, Louisiana segment, Oklahoma segment, North Texas segment, and Corporate segment. We evaluate the performance of our operating segments based on segment profit and adjusted gross margin. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to segment profit and adjusted gross margin is gross margin. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses to evaluate segment results. [/995]

[941]: Valuation of Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, determined by the first-in, first-out method. Inventory is recorded using standard cost, including material, labor and overhead costs. The Company periodically reviews inventories for potential impairment and adjusts inventory for potentially excess or obsolete goods to state inventories at their net realizable value. Factors influencing these adjustments include quantities on hand and firm purchase commitments, expectations of future use, judgments based on quality control testing data and assessments of the likelihood of scrapping or obsoleting certain inventories based on future demand for its products and market conditions. [/941]
[838]: Critical Accounting Policies Involving Management Estimates and Assumptions [/838]
[839]: Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about our financial condition and results of operations that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. [/839]
[1131]: Table element - Text before table: Purchase Obligations The Company has agreements with suppliers and other parties to purchase inventory, other goods and services and long-lived assets. Product inventory obligations consist primarily of purchase order commitments for raw materials used in the production of insulin pumps and cartridges, and finished goods infusion sets. Cancellation of outstanding purchase orders is generally allowed under the standard terms of our purchase order agreements, but may require payment of costs incurred through the date of cancellation. At December 31, 2023, obligations under our purchase agreements totaled approximately $ 189.2 million, of which approximately $ 181.5 million is scheduled to be received and become payable within one-year.

[1111]: 11. Business Segment and Geographic Information [/1111]
[1112]: Segment Reporting Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision-maker (CODM) in making decisions regarding resource allocation and assessing performance. The Company is organized based on its current product portfolio, which consists primarily of insulin pumps, single-use insulin cartridges and infusion sets for the storage and delivery of insulin. The Company views its operations and manages its business as one segment and a single reporting unit because key operating decisions and resource allocations are made by the CODM using consolidated financial data. [/1112]
[1113]: Disaggregation of Revenue [/1113]
[1114]: The Company primarily sells its products through national and regional distributors in the United States on a non-exclusive basis, and through distribution partners outside the United States. In the United States and Canada, the Company also uses a direct sales force. The Company disaggregates its revenue by geography and by major sales channel as management believes these categories best depict how the nature, amount and timing of revenues and cash flows are affected by economic factors.

Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable. The Company maintains deposit accounts in federally insured financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits. The Company also maintains investments in money market funds that are not federally insured. Additionally, the Company has established guidelines regarding investment instruments and their maturities, which are designed to maintain preservation of principal and liquidity.

[930]: There have been no material changes to the Company’s significant accounting policies during the year ended December 31, 2023, except for adding the accounting policy for sales rebates, which is included herein. [/930]
[931]: Use of Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. [/931]
[242]: Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry [/242]
[243]: We have incurred significant operating losses since inception and cannot assure you that we will achieve sustained profitability. [/243]
[244]: Since our inception in January 2006, we have incurred a significant net loss. As of December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $951.8 million. To date, we have funded our operations primarily through cash collected from product sales, private and public offerings of our equity securities, and debt financing. We have devoted substantially all of our resources to the design, development and commercialization of our products, the scaling of our manufacturing and business operations, and the research and development of our current products and products under development. [/244]
[245]: Since the first quarter of 2013, we have been able to manufacture and sell our insulin pump products at a cost and in volumes sufficient to allow us to achieve a positive overall gross margin. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, our gross profits were $367.7 million and $413.0 million, respectively. Although we have achieved a positive overall gross margin during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had net losses from operations of $222.6 million and $94.6 million, respectively, and we may continue to incur losses in the future. [/245]
[926]: Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation The Company has prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP. The statements include the accounts of Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries in the United States, Canada, Netherlands, and Switzerland. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The functional currency of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is their respective local currency. The Company translates the financial statements of its foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates for each period for revenue, costs and expenses. Translation related adjustments are included in other comprehensive income (loss), and in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the stockholders’ equity section of the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from balances denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are recognized in interest income and other, net in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. [/926]

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. [/887]

[840]: While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. [/840]
[841]: 70 [/841]
[842]: Revenue Recognition [/842]
[843]: Our revenue is generated primarily from sales of our insulin pumps, single-use insulin cartridges and infusion sets to individual customers with third-party insurance coverage and through a network of distributors that resell the products to insulin-dependent diabetes customers. We are paid directly by customers who use the products, distributors and third-party insurance payors. We recognize revenue when control of our products is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive from our customers in exchange for those products, net of estimated returns and rebates. This process involves identifying the contract with a customer, determining the performance obligations in the contract, determining the contract price, allocating the contract price to the distinct performance obligations in the contract, and recognizing revenue when the performance obligations have been satisfied. Revenue recognition for contracts with multiple performance obligations is based on the separate satisfaction of each distinct performance obligation within the contract. A performance obligation is considered distinct from other obligations in a contract when it provides a benefit to the customer either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and is separately identified in the contract. We consider a performance obligation satisfied once we have transferred control of a product to the customer, meaning the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain the benefit from the product. Complementary products, such as the t:connect, Tandem Source and the Tandem Device Updater, are considered distinct performance obligations satisfied over time, as access and support for these products is provided throughout the typical four-year warranty period of the insulin pumps. Accordingly, revenue related to the complementary products is deferred and recognized over a four-year period. When there is no standalone value for the complementary product, we determine its value by applying the expected cost plus a margin approach and then allocate the residual to the insulin pumps.

[535]: Revenue Recognition [/535]
[536]: As described in Notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements, product and service revenue of $1,258 million and $935 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2023, are disaggregated by seven product and service offerings including checks, merchant services and other payment solutions, marketing and promotional solutions, forms and other products, treasury management solutions, data-driven marketing solutions, and web and hosted solutions. Product revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods. In most cases, control is transferred when products are shipped. The Company recognizes the vast majority of service revenue as services are provided. The majority of the Company’s contracts are for the shipment of tangible products or the delivery of services that have a single performance obligation or include multiple performance obligations where control is transferred at the same time. [/536]
[358]: Consolidated Revenue [/358]
[360]: The decrease in total revenue for 2023, as compared to 2022, was driven, in part, by the business exits discussed in Executive Overview , which resulted in a decrease in revenue of approximately $52 million for 2023, as well as the continuing secular decline in order volume for checks, business forms and some Promotional Solutions business accessories. These decreases in revenue were partially offset by price increases in response to the inflationary environment, primarily in our Promotional Solutions and Checks segments, as well as growth from new business and favorable volumes for data-driven marketing and merchant services. [/360]
[361]: We do not manage our business based on product versus service revenue. Instead, we analyze our revenue based on the product and service offerings shown under the caption ""Note 17: Business Segment Information"" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Part II, Item 8 of this report. Our revenue mix by business segment was as follows: [/361]
[537]: The principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition is a critical audit matter is a high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures related to the Company’s revenue recognition. [/537]
[538]: Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process. These procedures also included, among others, testing, on a sample basis, whether the criteria for revenue recognition have been met by obtaining and inspecting source documents, including customer order information, the related customer contract, invoices, proof of shipment or delivery and cash receipts, as applicable.

[364]: Consolidated Cost of Revenue [/364]
[366]: Cost of revenue consists primarily of raw materials used to manufacture our products, shipping and handling costs, third-party costs for outsourced products and services, payroll and related expenses, information technology costs, depreciation and amortization of assets used in the production process and in support of digital service offerings, and related overhead. [/366]
[367]: The decrease in total cost of revenue for 2023, as compared to 2022, was driven by reduced revenue volume from the continuing secular decline in checks, business forms and some Promotional Solutions business accessories, as well as a decrease of approximately $27 million from the business exits discussed under Executive Overview . Partially offsetting these decreases in total cost of revenue was inflationary pressures on hourly wages, materials and delivery, as well as the revenue growth from new business and favorable volumes, primarily data-driven marketing and merchant services. In addition, investments in the business increased, including some cost pressures in our Payments lockbox business earlier in the year as we continued to consolidate these operations. Restructuring and integration expense included in total cost of revenue increased $11.6 million as we continued to pursue cost reductions and growth initiatives. [/367]

[426]: Payments [/426]
[427]: Results for our Payments segment were as follows: [/427]
[429]: The increase in total revenue for 2023, as compared to 2022, was due to an increase in merchant services revenue of 4.8%, driven by strong merchant fees and volume. Treasury management revenue was flat year-over-year as price increases in response to the inflationary environment were offset by the impact of non-recurring revenue in the prior year and continued demand softness for lockbox services. For 2024, we expect mid-single digit percentage revenue growth for this segment. [/429]

[320]: • Critical Accounting Estimates that discusses the estimates that involve a significant level of uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. [/320]
[493]: The fair value of acquired trade names and technology is estimated, at times, using the relief from royalty method, which calculates the cost savings associated with owning rather than licensing the assets. Assumed royalty rates are applied to projected revenue for the estimated remaining useful lives of the assets to estimate the royalty savings. Royalty rates are selected based on the attributes of the asset, including its recognition and reputation in the industry, and in the case of trade names, with consideration of the specific profitability of the products sold under a trade name and supporting assets. The fair value of acquired technology may also be estimated using the cost of reproduction method under which the primary components of the technology are identified and the estimated cost to reproduce the technology is calculated based on historical data provided by the acquiree. [/493]
[494]: The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to impairment testing on at least an annual basis. [/494]

[675]: 2023 divestiture / business exits – In June 2023, we completed the sale of our North American web hosting and logo design businesses for net cash proceeds of $ 31,230 , and we recognized a pretax gain of $ 17,486 . These businesses generated annual revenue of approximately $ 66,000 during 2022, primarily in our Data Solutions segment.

Foreign currency exchange rate risk – We are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Investments in, and loans and advances to, foreign subsidiaries and branches, as well as the operations of these businesses, are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily Canadian dollars. The effect of exchange rate changes is expected to have a minimal impact on our earnings and cash flows, as our foreign operations represent a relatively small portion of our business.

[333]: In May 2022, we completed the sale of our Australian web hosting business, and we also sold our Promotional Solutions strategic sourcing and retail packaging businesses during 2022. These businesses generated annual revenue of approximately $24 million in our Data Solutions segment and approximately $29 million in our Promotional Solutions segment during 2021. [/333]

[/334]
[335]: 2023 Financial Results [/335]
[336]: Cash flows and liquidity – Cash provided by operating activities for 2023 increased $6.8 million as compared to 2022, driven by positive changes in working capital, pricing and cost saving actions, and a decrease of $9.5 million in payments for cloud computing implementation costs related to the implementation of our ERP system, which was completed in early 2023. Growth in data-driven marketing and merchant services revenue also contributed to the increase in operating cash flow. Partially offsetting these increases in operating cash flow was a $28.4 million increase in interest payments as a result of rising interest rates, as well as a $9.5 million increase in employee bonus payments related to our 2022 operating performance and a $9.3 million increase in income tax payments driven, in large part, by the timing of our federal tax payments. Operating cash flow was also negatively impacted by the continuing secular decline in checks, business forms and certain Promotional Solutions business accessories, inflationary pressures on hourly wages, materials and delivery, and the impact of business exits. Free cash flow increased $10.7 million for 2023, as compared to 2022. Total debt was $1.59 billion and net debt was $1.52 billion as of December 31, 2023. We held cash and cash equivalents of $72.0 million as of December 31, 2023, and liquidity was $312.5 million. Our capital allocation priorities are to reduce our debt and net leverage, deliver high return internal investments and pay our dividend. We continue to responsibly invest the free cash flow generated by our Checks and Promotional Solutions businesses into Payments and Data Solutions, businesses that we believe can generate more robust growth over time. A reconciliation of free cash flow, net debt and liquidity to the comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Consolidated Results of Operations . [/336]

[521]: Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting [/521]
[522]: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Deluxe Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of shareholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). [/522]
[523]: In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. [/523]
[438]: Table element - Text before table: The decrease in adjusted EBITDA for 2023, as compared to 2022, was driven by the business exits discussed under Executive Overview , which reduced adjusted EBITDA by approximately $13 million for 2023, as well as the decrease in North American web hosting revenue prior to the divestiture. These decreases in adjusted EBITDA were partially offset by the growth in data-driven marketing and the benefit of various cost reduction actions. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased for 2023, as compared to 2022, as the shift toward data-driven marketing revenue was offset by expense management. For 2024, we expect that adjusted EBITDA will decline approximately $9 million due to business exits, and we expect that adjusted EBITDA margin will be in the low 20% range.

[608]: Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates [/608]
[609]: The consolidated financial statements included in this report are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and their notes, including reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. We believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. [/609]

The Investment Management segment includes Wealth Management and interests in private equity funds which are not managed by the Company. The Company's segment information for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 is prepared using the following methodology: • Revenue, expenses and income (loss) from equity method investments directly associated with each segment are included in determining pre-tax income. • Expenses not directly associated with specific segments are allocated based on the most relevant measures applicable, including headcount, square footage and other performance and time-based factors. • Segment assets are based on those directly associated with each segment, or for certain assets shared across segments, those assets are allocated based on the most relevant measures applicable, including headcount and other factors. • Investment gains and losses, interest income and interest expense are allocated between the segments based on the segment in which the underlying asset or liability is held. Other Revenue, net, included in each segment's Net Revenues includes the following: • Interest income, including accretion, and income (losses) on investment securities, including the Company's investment funds (which are used as an economic hedge against the Company's deferred cash compensation program), certificates of deposit, cash and cash equivalents, long-term accounts receivable and on the Company’s debt security investment in G5 (through June 25, 2021, the date G5 repaid its outstanding debentures with the Company in full. See Note 10 for further information.) • A gain on the sale of a portion of the Company's interests in ABS in 2022. See Note 10 for further information • Gains (losses) resulting from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and foreign currency exchange forward contracts used as an economic hedge • Realized and unrealized gains and losses on interests in private equity funds which are not managed by the Company [/1053]

[794]: The Company's contract assets represent arrangements in which an estimate of variable consideration has been included in the transaction price and thereby recognized as revenue that precedes the contractual due date. Under ASC 606, revenue is recognized when all material conditions for completion have been met and it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur in a future period. [/794]
[795]: The Company recognized revenue of $ 29,587 , $ 44,579 and $ 28,657 on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, that was initially included in deferred revenue within Other Current Liabilities on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.

[632]: Investment Management Revenue [/632]
[633]: Our Investment Management segment generates revenues from the management of client assets and through interests in private equity funds which we do not manage. Our contracts with customers may include promises to transfer multiple services to a customer. Determining whether services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. For performance obligations satisfied over time, determining a measure of progress requires us to make significant judgments that affect the timing of revenue recognized. [/633]
[634]: Asset management fees for third-party clients are generally based on the value of the assets under management and any performance fees that may be negotiated with the client. The management of asset portfolios represents a distinct performance obligation that is satisfied over time. These fees are generally recognized over the period that the related services are provided and in which the performance obligation is satisfied, based upon the beginning, ending or average value of the assets for the relevant period. Fees paid in advance of services rendered are initially recorded as deferred revenue (a contract liability), which is recorded in Other Current Liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, and are recognized in Asset Management and Administration Fees on the Consolidated Statements of Operations ratably over the period in which the related service is rendered.

[387]: Key Financial Measures [/387]
[388]: Revenue [/388]
[389]: Total revenues reflect revenues from our Investment Banking & Equities and Investment Management business segments that include fees for services, transaction-related client reimbursements and other revenue. Net revenues reflect total revenues less interest expense. [/389]
[390]: Investment Banking & Equities. Our Investment Banking & Equities segment earns fees from its clients for providing advice on mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, capital raising, leveraged buyouts, liability management and restructurings, private funds advisory and private capital markets services, activism and defense and similar corporate finance matters, and from underwriting and private placement activities, as well as commissions, fees and principal revenues from research and sales and trading activities. The amount and timing of the fees paid vary by the type of engagement or services provided. In general, advisory fees are paid at the time we sign an engagement letter, during the course of the engagement or when an engagement is completed. The majority of our revenue consists of advisory fees for which realizations are dependent on the successful completion of client transactions. A transaction can fail to be completed for many reasons which are outside of our control, including failure of parties to agree upon final terms with the counterparty, to secure necessary board or shareholder approvals, to secure necessary financing, to achieve necessary regulatory approvals, or due to adverse market conditions. In the case of bankruptcy engagements, fees may be subject to court approval. Underwriting fees are recognized when the offering has been deemed to be completed and placement fees are generally recognized at the time of the client's acceptance of capital or capital commitments. Commissions and Related Revenue includes commissions, which are recorded on a trade-date basis or, in the case of payments under commission sharing arrangements, on the date earned. Commissions and Related Revenue also includes subscription fees for the sales of research, as well as revenues from trades primarily executed on a riskless principal basis. Cash received before the subscription period ends is initially recorded as deferred revenue (a contract liability) and recognized as revenue over the remaining subscription period. [/390]
[391]: Revenue trends in our advisory business generally are correlated to the volume of M&A activity, restructuring activity, which generally tends to be counter-cyclical to M&A, and capital advisory activity. Demand for these capabilities can vary in any given year or quarter for a number of reasons. For example, changes in our market share or the ability of our clients to close certain large transactions can cause our revenue results to diverge from the level of overall M&A, restructuring or capital advisory activity. Revenue trends in our equities business are correlated, in part, to market volumes, which generally decrease in periods of low market volatility or unfavorable market or economic conditions. See ""Liquidity and Capital Resources"" below for further information. [/391]
[392]: Investment Management. Our Investment Management segment includes operations related to the Wealth Management business and interests in private equity funds which we do not manage. Revenue sources primarily include management fees, fiduciary fees and gains (or losses) on our investments. [/392]

[288]: Segment Profit and Segment Margin [/288]
[289]: Segment profit is calculated as net sales less costs of goods sold, operating expenses, and certain non-operating expenses attributable to the segment (e.g., foreign currency), excluding general corporate expenses, net interest expense, intangible asset amortization, and other unallocated amounts that are primarily driven by corporate initiatives. Operating expenses include SG&A at our segments. Segment profit as a percentage of segment net sales is referred to as segment margin. [/289]
[290]: 20 [/290]
[291]: Table of Contents [/291]
[292]: We believe that segment profit and segment margin are useful measures because they allow management, analysts, investors, and other interested parties to evaluate the profitability of our segments, after the effects of operating and other expenses and income associated with those businesses. Refer to the Segment Data Footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. [/292]
[293]: Net Income and EBITDA [/293]
[294]: We believe that net income and EBITDA, along with their adjusted measures, are useful measures of operating performance. EBITDA helps us assess the underlying profitability of our company’s business operations before the effects of certain net expenses that directly arise from our capital investment decisions (depreciation, amortization), financing decisions (interest), and tax strategies (income taxes). Net Income represents our profitability after the effects of all operating and other expenses and income. [/294]
[360]: (1) Amounts are the same as adjustments included within the adjusted net income table above. [/360]
[361]: (2) Represents GAAP net income as a percentage of GAAP net sales. [/361]
[362]: (3) Represents total segment profit as a percentage of GAAP net sales. [/362]

[365]: The table below represents a reconciliation from segment profit to segment EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA: [/365]
[367]: (1)    These represent costs for certain functions, including cybersecurity and product liability litigation that were transferred to Corporate beginning in 2023 to be streamlined and centrally managed. We presented the 2022 comparative period to reflect how management manages these costs in 2023 and going forward. [/367]
[368]: (2)    Amounts are the same as adjustments included within the adjusted net income table above. [/368]
[369]: OUTLOOK [/369]
[370]: We expect continued revenue and earnings growth in 2024, despite uncertain economic conditions. Positive trends related to miles driven, aging vehicles and continued limited new car inventory remain supportive of the sustained demand for our global Automotive business. In addition, we believe our Industrial business benefits from the diversity of our product and service offerings. We expect our growing capabilities in industrial solutions, including automation, fluid power and conveyance to be differentiators for our business. [/370]

[284]: Gross Profit and Gross Margin [/284]
[285]: Gross profit represents net sales less cost of goods sold. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales is referred to as gross margin. Cost of goods sold primarily represents the cost of merchandise sold, including the cost of inbound freight from suppliers. It also includes the effects of supplier volume incentives and inventory adjustments. Our gross profit is variable in nature and generally follows changes in net sales. We believe that gross profit and gross margin are useful measures because they allow management, analysts, investors and others to evaluate the profit we generate from our sales, before operating and other expenses and income. [/285]
[286]: Selling, Administrative and Other Expenses (""SG&A"") [/286]
[287]: SG&A includes all personnel and personnel-related costs at our corporate offices, segment headquarters, distribution centers, stores and branches, which accounts for more than 60% of total SG&A. Additional costs in SG&A include our facilities, freight and delivery, marketing, advertising, technology, digital, legal and professional costs. Freight and delivery costs are the shipping and handling costs incurred related to delivering merchandise to our customers. We believe SG&A is a useful measure because it allows management, analysts, investors and others to understand the level of costs we incur operating our business each period. [/287]
[701]: For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, approximately $ 5 million of inventory amortization step-up cost related to this acquisition was included in cost of goods sold. Further, $ 62 million of transaction and other one-time costs, inclusive of an impairment charge, were included in selling, administrative, and other expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Refer to the Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Footnote for more information on the impairment charge. [/701]
[702]: If the KDG acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2021 and if its results of operations had been included in our consolidated results since that date, our unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of income would have reflected net sales of approximately $ 22.1 billion and $ 19.9 billion and net income on a per share diluted basis of $ 8.47 and $ 6.02 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively . The pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that we would have reported had the transaction actually occurred at the beginning of this period, nor is it necessarily indicative of future results.

[470]: Table element - Text before table: We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.; table: (row 0)

 (col 1): Loss Contingencies Related to Product Liabilities (row end);
 (row 2) 
 (col 0): Description of the Matter (col 1): As disclosed in Notes 1 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is subject to pending product liability lawsuits resulting from its national distribution of automotive parts and supplies. The Company accrues for loss contingencies related to product liabilities if it is probable that the Company will incur a loss and the loss can be reasonably estimated. The amount accrued for product liabilities as of December 31, 2023 was $244 million. Auditing the Company’s loss contingencies related to product liabilities was complex due to the significant measurement uncertainty associated with the estimate, management’s application of significant judgment and the use of valuation techniques. In addition, the loss contingencies related to product liabilities are sensitive to significant management assumptions, including the number, type, and severity of claims incurred and estimated to be incurred in future periods.

[551]: 2. Segment Data [/551]
[552]: Our reportable segments consist of the Automotive Parts Group (""Automotive"") and Industrial Parts Group (""Industrial""). Within the reportable segments, certain of our operating segments are aggregated since they have similar economic characteristics, products and services, type and class of customers, and distribution methods. [/552]
[553]: Our Automotive segment distributes replacement parts (other than body parts) for substantially all makes and models of automobiles, trucks, and other vehicles. [/553]
[554]: Our Industrial segment distributes a wide variety of industrial bearings, mechanical and fluid power transmission equipment, including hydraulic and pneumatic products, material handling components and related parts and supplies. [/554]
[555]: Inter-segment sales are not significant. Segment profit for each industry segment is calculated as net sales less costs of goods sold, operating expenses, and certain non-operating expenses attributable to the segment (e.g., foreign currency), excluding general corporate expenses, net interest expense, intangible asset amortization, and other unallocated amounts that are primarily driven by corporate initiatives. Approximately $ 577 million, $ 472 million, and $ 438 million of income before income taxes were generated in jurisdictions outside the U.S. for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Net sales and net property, plant and equipment by country relate directly to our operations in the respective country. Corporate assets are principally cash and cash equivalents and headquarters’ facilities and equipment. [/555]

[956]: Table element - Text before table: Product revenues, net, for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased to $305.2 million as compared to $245.4 million in 2022 as a result of the growth in sales of ARIKAYCE in the US, Japan and Europe and the rest of the world. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we reached an agreement with the French authorities on the final reimbursement price related to the ATU program in France and we are required to refund the difference. This final pricing resulted in a change in estimate that reduced revenue by approximately $7.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, of which $5.8 million related to periods prior to 2022.

[1212]: Inventory and Cost of Product Revenues (excluding amortization of intangible assets) —Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Inventory is sold on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. The Company periodically reviews inventory for expiry and obsolescence and, if necessary, writes down accordingly. If quality specifications are not met during the manufacturing process, such inventory is written off to cost of product revenues (excluding amortization of intangible assets) in the period identified. Cost of product revenues (excluding amortization of intangible assets) consist primarily of direct and indirect costs related to the manufacturing of ARIKAYCE sold, including third-party manufacturing costs, packaging services, freight, and allocation of overhead costs, in addition to royalty expenses and revenue-based milestone payments. Cost is determined using a standard cost method, which approximates actual cost, and assumes a FIFO flow of goods. Prior to FDA approval of ARIKAYCE, the Company expensed all inventory-related costs in the period incurred. Inventory used for clinical development purposes is expensed to R&D expense when consumed. Research and Development —R&D expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel serving in the Company's research and development functions, including medical affairs. R&D expense also includes other internal operating expenses, the cost of manufacturing a product candidate, including the medical devices for drug delivery, for clinical study, the cost of conducting clinical studies, and the cost of conducting preclinical and research activities. In addition, R&D expenses include payments to third parties for the license rights to products in development (prior to marketing approval), such as brensocatib, and may include the cost of asset acquisitions (as described further above). The Company's expenses related to manufacturing its product candidates and medical devices for clinical study are primarily related to activities at CMOs that manufacture its clinical product supply of ARIKAYCE, brensocatib, TPIP and early-stage research. The Company's expenses related to clinical trials are primarily related to activities at CROs that conduct and manage clinical trials on the Company's behalf. These contracts set forth the scope of work to be completed at a fixed fee or amount per patient enrolled. Payments under these contracts primarily depend on performance criteria such as the successful enrollment of patients or the completion of clinical trial milestones as well as time-based fees. Expenses are accrued based on contracted amounts applied to the level of patient enrollment and to activity according to the clinical trial protocol. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are deferred and capitalized. Such amounts are then recognized as an expense as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed, or when the goods or services are no longer expected to be provided. Stock-based Compensation —The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees and directors based on the grant-date fair value of those awards. The grant-date fair value of the award is recognized as compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period, which generally equals the vesting period of the award. The Company may also grant performance-based stock options and performance stock units (PSUs) to employees from time to time. The grant-date fair value of performance-based stock options is recognized as compensation expense over the implicit service period using the accelerated attribution method once it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. The grant-date fair value of performance stock units is recognized as compensation expense on the date the performance conditions become probable, with an initial recording of the cumulative expense that would have been recognized if the PSU expense had been recognized on a straight-line basis since the date of grant. The remaining unamortized fair value of the awards will then be expensed prospectively on a straight-line basis over the remaining service period. Stock-based compensation expense is included in both R&D and SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. Investment Income and Interest Expense —Investment income consists of interest income earned on the Company's cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest expense consists primarily of contractual interest costs related to the Company's debt, non-cash interest expense related to the Company's Royalty Financing Agreement (see Note 11) and amortization of debt issuance costs related to the Company's debt. Income Taxes —The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, the Company takes into account various factors, including the expected level of [/1212]
[1191]: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Celtrix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Insmed Holdings Limited, Insmed Gene Therapy LLC, Insmed Ireland Limited, Insmed France SAS, Insmed Germany GmbH, Insmed Limited, Insmed Netherlands Holdings B.V., Insmed Netherlands B.V., Insmed Godo Kaisha, Insmed Switzerland GmbH, Insmed Italy S.R.L., Insmed Innovation UK Limited, and Adrestia Therapeutics Inc. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. [/1191]
[1192]: 2.      Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Use of Estimates —The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions. The amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the Company's balance sheets and the amounts of revenues and expenses reported for each period presented are affected by estimates and assumptions, which are used for, but not limited to, the accounting for revenue allowances, stock-based compensation, income taxes, loss contingencies, acquisition related intangibles including in process research and development (IPR&D) and goodwill, fair value of contingent consideration, and accounting for research and development costs. Actual results could differ from those estimates. [/1192]
[1383]: The Company completed an Internal Revenue Code Section 382 (Section 382) analysis in order to determine the amount of losses that are currently available for potential offset against future taxable income, if any. It was determined that the utilization of the Company's NOL and general business tax credit carryforwards generated in tax periods up to and including December 2010 were subject to substantial limitations under Section 382 due to ownership changes that occurred at various points from the Company's original organization through December 2010. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, results from transactions increasing the ownership of shareholders that own, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of a corporation's stock, in the stock of a corporation by more than 50 percentage points over a testing period (usually 3 years). Since the Company's formation in 1999, it has raised capital through the issuance of common stock on several occasions [/1383]

[1207]: The Company is exposed to risks associated with extending credit to customers related to the sale of products. The Company does not require collateral to secure amounts due from its customers. The Company uses an expected loss methodology to calculate allowances for trade receivables. The Company's measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. The Company does not currently have a material allowance for uncollectible trade receivables. The following table presents the percentage of gross product revenue represented by the Company's three largest customers as of the year ended December 31, 2023 and their respective percentages for the year ended December 31, 2022. [/1207]
[1209]: The Company relies on third-party manufacturers and suppliers for manufacturing and supply of its products. The inability of the suppliers or manufacturers to fulfill supply requirements of the Company could materially impact future operating results. A change in the relationship with the suppliers or manufacturers, or an adverse change in their business, could materially impact future operating results. [/1209]
[1257]: 4.      Product Revenues, Net [/1257]
[1258]: In accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, the Company recognizes revenue when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for the goods or services provided. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (1) identify the contracts with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation. At contract inception, the Company assesses the goods or services promised within each contract to determine which are performance obligations and to assess whether each promised good or service is distinct. The Company then recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when or as the performance obligation is satisfied. For all contracts that fall into the scope of ASC 606, the Company has identified one performance obligation: the sale of ARIKAYCE to its customers. The Company has not incurred or capitalized any incremental costs associated with obtaining contracts with customers. [/1258]

[1037]: We have raised $1.8 billion in net proceeds from securities offerings since 2021. We believe we currently have sufficient funds to meet our financial needs for at least the next 12 months. However, our business strategy may require us to raise additional capital at any time through equity or debt financing(s), strategic transactions or otherwise. [/1037]
[1038]: Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements [/1038]
[1039]: We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. We do not have any interest in special purpose entities, structured finance entities or other variable interest entities. [/1039]
[1040]: CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES [/1040]
[1041]: Preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We use our historical experience and other relevant factors when developing our estimates and assumptions and we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions. The amounts of assets and liabilities reported in our consolidated balance sheets and the amounts reported in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss are affected by estimates and assumptions, which are used for, but not limited to, the accounting for revenue recognition and indefinite-lived intangible assets. The accounting estimates discussed below involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. For additional accounting policies, see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our notes to the consolidated financial statements. . [/1041]

[1288]: Accounts payable and accrued liabilities consist of the following (in thousands): [/1288]
[1290]: 9.      Leases The Company's lease portfolio consists primarily of office and laboratory space, manufacturing facilities, research equipment and fleet vehicles. All of the Company's leases are classified as operating leases, except for the Company's leases of its corporate headquarters and a research facility in San Diego, which are classified as finance leases. The terms of the Company's lease agreements that have commenced range from less than one year to ten years, ten months . In its assessment of the term of each such lease, the Company has not included any options to extend or terminate the lease due to the absence of economic incentives in its lease agreements. Leases that qualify for treatment as a short-term lease are expensed as incurred. These short-term leases are not material to the Company's financial position. Furthermore, the Company does not separate lease and non-lease components for all classes of underlying assets. The Company's leases do not contain residual value guarantees and it does not sublease any of its leased assets. The Company outsources its manufacturing operations to CMOs. Upon review of the agreements with its CMOs, the Company determined that these contracts contain embedded leases for dedicated manufacturing facilities. The Company obtains substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the manufacturing facilities, the Company has the right to direct how and for what purpose the facility is used throughout the period of use, and the supplier does not have the right to change the operating instructions of the facility. The operating lease right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities associated with the manufacturing facilities is the sum of the minimum guarantees over the life of the production contracts.

[1198]: If determined to be an asset acquisition, the Company accounts for the transaction under ASC 805-50, which requires the acquiring entity in an asset acquisition to recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the cost to the acquiring entity on a relative fair value basis, which includes transaction costs in addition to consideration given. No gain or loss is recognized as of the date of acquisition unless the fair value of non-cash assets given as consideration differs from the assets’ carrying amounts on the acquiring entity’s books. Consideration transferred that is non-cash will be measured based on either the cost (which shall be measured based on the fair value of the consideration given) or the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, whichever is more reliably measurable. Goodwill is not recognized in an asset acquisition and any excess consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is allocated to the identifiable assets based on relative fair values. If the in-licensed agreement for IPR&D does not meet the definition of a business and the assets have not reached technological feasibility and therefore have no alternative future use, the Company expenses payments made under such license agreements as acquired IPR&D expense in its consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. Contingent consideration payments in asset acquisitions are recognized when the contingency is resolved and the consideration is paid or becomes payable, unless the contingent consideration meets the definition of a derivative, in which case the amount becomes part of the basis in the asset acquired. None of the Company's contingent consideration met the definition of a derivative. Upon recognition of the contingent consideration payment, the amount is included in the cost of the acquired asset or group of assets. Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets— Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of IPR&D. IPR&D acquired directly in a transaction other than a business combination is capitalized if the projects will be further developed or have an alternative future use; otherwise, they are expensed. The fair values of IPR&D project assets acquired in business combinations are capitalized. The Company generally utilizes the Multi-Period Excess Earning Method to determine the estimated fair value of the IPR&D assets acquired in a business combination. The projections used in this valuation approach are based on many factors, such as relevant market size, patent protection, and expected pricing and industry trends. The estimated future net cash flows are then discounted to the present value using an appropriate discount rate. These assets are treated as indefinite-lived intangible"

The revenues are reported in USD and in millions. The revenues are reported for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the duration is 12 months. The revenues are reported in two categories: parts and services and other. The parts and services revenue is generated from the sale of vehicle products, including replacement parts, components and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles, and specialty products and accessories used to improve the performance, functionality and appearance of vehicles. The service revenue is generated primarily from the sale of service-type warranties, fees for admission to self service yards, and diagnostic and repair services. The other revenue includes scrap and other metals sales, bulk sales to mechanical manufacturers and sales of aluminum ingots and sows from furnace operations.","```json

- The company's total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, was $13,089 million. (Source: [758])
- The company reports its revenue in two categories: (i) parts and services and (ii) other. During the year ended December 31, 2023, parts and services revenue represented 95.0% of the company's consolidated revenue. (Source: [449])
- The increase in parts and services revenue of 10.4% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, was driven by organic parts and services revenue growth of 4.7%, a 4.8% increase due to the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, and a 0.9% increase due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. (Source: [498])
- The decrease in other revenue of 19.6% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, was primarily driven by a decrease in organic revenue of $138 million due to unfavorable movements in precious metals and scrap steel prices compared to the prior year.

[496]: The following table summarizes the changes in revenue by category (in millions): [/496]
[498]: The increase in parts and services revenue of 10.4% represented increases in segment revenue of 18.2% in Wholesale - North America, 10.4% in Europe, and 2.4% in Self Service, partially offset by a decrease of 6.9% in Specialty. This overall increase was driven by organic parts and services revenue growth of 4.7%, a 4.8% increase due to the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, and a 0.9% increase due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The decrease in other revenue of 19.6% was primarily driven by a decrease in organic revenue of $138 million due to unfavorable movements in precious metals and scrap steel prices compared to the prior year, primarily attributable to a $93 million decrease in our Self Service segment and a $41 million decrease in our Wholesale - North America segment. Refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to the changes in revenue by segment for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.

[782]: Sales tax and other tax amounts collected from customers for remittance to governmental authorities are excluded from revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income and are shown as a current liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets until remitted. Any incremental costs to obtain a contract (commissions earned by our sales representatives on product sales) are expensed when incurred, as the amortization period of the asset would be one year or less due to the short-term nature of our contracts. Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold includes: the price we pay for inventory, net of vendor discounts, rebates or other incentives; inbound freight and other transportation costs to bring inventory into our facilities; and overhead costs related to purchasing, warehousing and transporting our products from our distribution warehouses to our selling locations. For our salvage, remanufactured, refurbished and manufactured products, cost of goods sold also includes direct and indirect labor, equipment costs, depreciation, and other overhead to transform inventory into finished products suitable for sale. Cost of goods sold also includes expenses for service-type warranties and for assurance-type warranty programs. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses include: personnel costs for employees in SG&A functions; costs to operate branch locations, corporate offices and back office support centers; costs to transport products from facilities to our customers; and other expenses, such as professional fees, supplies, and advertising expenses. The costs included in SG&A expenses do not relate to inventory processing or conversion activities, and, as such, are classified below Gross margin in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Stock-Based Compensation For the restricted stock units (""RSUs"") that contain both a performance-based vesting condition and a time-based vesting condition, we recognize compensation expense using the accelerated attribution method, pursuant to which expense is recognized straight-line over the requisite service period for each separate vesting tranche of the award. For all other awards, which are subject to only a time-based vesting condition, we recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the entire award. For performance-based RSUs (""PSUs""), the expense is calculated using the projected award value, which is based on an estimate of the achievement of the performance objectives, and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the performance period. The impacts of forfeitures on RSUs and PSUs expense are recorded as they occur. Income Taxes Current income taxes are provided on income reported for financial reporting purposes, adjusted for transactions that do not enter into the computation of income taxes payable in the same year. Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit or that future deductibility is uncertain. Provision is made for taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and related companies to the extent that such earnings are not deemed to be permanently invested. We recognize the benefits of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns in the provision for income taxes only for those positions that are more likely than not to be realized. We follow a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. Our policy is to include any interest and penalties associated with income tax obligations in income tax expense. [/782]
[447]: 35 [/447]
[448]: Sources of Revenue [/448]
[449]: We report our revenue in two categories: (i) parts and services and (ii) other. Our parts revenue is generated from the sale of vehicle products, including replacement parts, components and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles, and specialty products and accessories used to improve the performance, functionality and appearance of vehicles. Our service revenue is generated primarily from the sale of service-type warranties, fees for admission to our self service yards, and diagnostic and repair services. During the year ended December 31, 2023, parts and services revenue represented 95.0% of our consolidated revenue. Revenue from other sources includes scrap and other metals (including precious metals - platinum, palladium and rhodium - contained in recycled parts such as catalytic converters) sales, bulk sales to mechanical manufacturers (including cores) and sales of aluminum ingots and sows from our furnace operations. Other revenue will vary from period to period based on fluctuations in commodity prices and the volume of materials sold. See Note 13, ""Revenue Recognition"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our sources of revenue.

[482]: Key Performance Indicators [/482]
[483]: We believe that organic revenue growth, Segment EBITDA and free cash flow are key performance indicators for our business. Segment EBITDA is our key measure of segment profit or loss reviewed by our chief operating decision maker.

[485]: • Organic revenue growth - We define organic revenue growth as total revenue growth from continuing operations excluding the effects of acquisitions and divestitures (i.e., revenue generated from the date of acquisition to the first anniversary of that acquisition, net of reduced revenue due to the disposal of businesses) and foreign currency movements (i.e., impact of translating revenue at different exchange rates). Organic revenue growth includes incremental sales from both existing and new (i.e., opened within the last twelve months) locations and is derived from expanding business with existing customers, securing new customers and offering additional products and services. We believe that organic revenue growth is a key performance indicator as this statistic measures our ability to serve and grow our customer base successfully.

[788]: Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives or, in the case of leasehold improvements, the term of the related lease and reasonably assured renewal periods, if shorter. Depreciation expense associated with refurbishing, remanufacturing, manufacturing and furnace operations as well as distribution centers are recorded in Cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Depreciation expense resulting from restructuring programs is recorded in Restructuring and transaction related expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. All other depreciation expense is reported in Depreciation and amortization in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Expenditures for major additions and improvements that extend the useful life of the related asset are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are recorded as incurred to SG&A expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. As property, plant and equipment are sold or retired, the applicable cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss thereon is recognized. Construction in progress consists primarily of building and land improvements at our existing facilities. Intangible Assets Intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill (the cost of purchased businesses in excess of the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired) and other specifically identifiable intangible assets, such as trade names, trademarks, customer and supplier relationships, software and other technology related assets, and covenants not to compete. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually. We performed annual impairment tests during the fourth quarters of 2023, 2022 and 2021. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing may also be performed on an interim basis when events or circumstances arise that may lead to impairment. The fair value estimates of our goodwill reporting units were established using weightings of the results of a discounted cash flow methodology and a comparative market multiples approach. Based on the annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2023, we determined no impairment existed. The goodwill reporting units had a fair value estimate which exceeded the carrying value by at least 20 %. Leases We determine if an arrangement is a lease at contract inception with lease right-of-use (""ROU"") assets and lease liabilities being recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. In determining the present value of future lease payments, we use the incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date when the implicit rate is not readily determinable. We determine the incremental borrowing rate by analyzing yield curves with consideration of lease term, country and Company specific factors. In assessing the ROU asset, we include any lease prepayments and exclude lease incentives. We account for the lease and non-lease components of a contract as a single lease component and for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less, we have elected to not record an ROU asset and lease liability. In assessing the lease term, we include options to renew only when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. For certain lease agreements, rental payments are adjusted periodically for inflation. Typically, these adjustments are considered variable lease costs. Other variable lease costs consist of certain non-lease components that are disclosed as lease costs due to our election of the practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components and include items such as variable payments for utilities, property taxes, common area maintenance, sales taxes, and insurance. Net Assets Held for Sale We record the net assets of held for sale businesses at the lower of fair value less cost to sell or carrying value. Fair values are based on projected discounted cash flows and/or estimated selling prices. Management's assumptions for the discounted cash flow analyses of the businesses are based on projected revenues and profits, tax rates, capital expenditures, working capital requirements and discount rates. For businesses for which we utilized estimated selling prices to calculate the fair value, the inputs to the estimates included projected market multiples and any reasonable offers. Due to uncertainties in the estimation process, it is possible that actual results could differ from the estimates used in management's analysis. The inputs utilized in the fair value estimates are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. The fair values of the net assets were measured on a [/788]

[517]: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in the section titled “Part II, Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, equity, revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, accounting for income taxes and stock-based compensation.

[618]: Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 [/618]
[619]: Revenues [/619]
[621]: Revenues increased by $64.7 million in 2023 compared to 2022, driven by increased demand for our subscription services by our end customers. Of the total increase of $64.7 million in revenues, 80% was from customers existing at or prior to December 31, 2022, and the remaining 20% was from new customers added in 2023. Of the total increase of $64.7 million , 62% was from customers in the United States and the remaining 38% was from customers in foreign countries. In 2023, 57% of total revenues were direct and 43% of total revenues were through partners. Of the total increase of $64.7 million , 46% was direct and the remaining 54% was from partners. With our strong market position driving further demand for our solutions, we expect revenue growth from new and existing customers to continue. [/621]
[615]: Table element - Text before table: We are subject to federal, state and foreign income taxes for jurisdictions in which we operate, and we use estimates in determining our income tax provision and deferred tax assets. Earnings from our non-U.S. activities are subject to income taxes in the local countries at rates which are generally similar to the U.S. statutory tax rate. We regularly assess the realizability of our net deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2023, valuation allowances remain in certain jurisdictions where we believe it is necessary to see further positive evidence, such as sustained achievement of sufficient profits to meet a more likely than not stance that the valuation allowance should be reversed. If additional positive evidence becomes available in the foreseeable future, we may release all or a portion of the valuation allowance. The exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release is subject to change based on the level of profitability achieved in future periods. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and a corresponding decrease to income tax expense in the period the release is recorded.

[715]: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Qualys, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. [/715]
[687]: Critical Accounting Estimates [/687]
[688]: The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 - The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based on historical and anticipated results and trends that we believe represent our best estimate under the circumstances. However, as accounting estimates are subject to inherent uncertainty, our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. [/688]
[689]: Income Taxes [/689]
[690]: Significant assumptions, judgments and estimates are involved in determining our provision for (benefit from) income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our deferred tax assets. Our judgments, assumptions and estimates relating to the current provision for income taxes include the geographic mix and amount of income (loss), expectations of future income, our interpretation of current tax laws, our business, and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. Our judgments also include anticipating the tax positions we will record in the financial statements before preparing and filing the tax returns. Our estimates and assumptions may differ from the actual results as reflected in our income tax returns and we record the required adjustments when they are identified or resolved. Changes in our business and tax laws or our interpretation of those, and developments in current and future tax audits, could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Total comprehensive income includes net income and other comprehensive income (loss) and is included in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Foreign Currency Transactions The Company’s operations are conducted in various countries around the world and the financial statements of its foreign subsidiaries are reported in the U.S. dollar as their respective functional currency. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies have been re-measured into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and income and expenses are re-measured at average exchange rates during the period. Foreign currency re-measurement gains and losses and foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net. Net Income Per Share Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding plus potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period. The potentially dilutive shares are computed by applying the treasury stock method to the Company's stock options, RSUs and the stock purchase rights under the ESPP. Any potential shares that would be anti-dilutive are excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements None. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") 2023-07 requiring enhanced segment disclosures. The ASU requires disclosure of significant segment expenses regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (""CODM"") included within segment operating profit or loss. Additionally, the ASU requires a description of how the CODM utilizes segment operating profit or loss to assess segment performance. The requirements of the ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company's annual reporting requirements will be effective for fiscal 2024 and interim reporting requirements will be effective beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Early adoption is permitted and retrospective application is required for all periods presented. The Company is in the process of analyzing the impact of the ASU on related disclosures. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 requiring enhanced income tax disclosures. The ASU requires disclosure of specific categories and disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation table. The ASU also requires disclosure of disaggregated information related to income taxes paid, income or loss from continuing operations before income tax expense or benefit, and income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations. The requirements of the ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and the amendments should be applied on a prospective basis. Retrospective application is permitted. The Company is in the process of analyzing the impact of the ASU on related disclosures. The Company does not believe any other new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB that have not become effective will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. [/801]

[661]: • Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently or not at all, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. [/661]
[662]: Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should be considered alongside other financial performance measures, including revenues, net income, cash flows from operating activities and our financial results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. [/662]
[663]: The following unaudited table presents the reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. [/663]
[665]: Liquidity and Capital Resources [/665]
[666]: As of December 31, 2023 , our principal source of liquidity was cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $482.2 million, including $94.8 million of cash held outside of the United States. The following summary of cash flows for the periods indicated have been derived from our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report: [/666]
[668]: 49 [/668]
[669]: Table of Contents [/669]
[670]: Operating Activities [/670]
[671]: In 2023, we generated $226.4 million of cash from our net income, as adjusted for non-cash items mainly related to stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expense and deferred taxes, as compared to $177.2 million in 2022. In addition, we also generated $18.2 million of cash from working capital change in 2023, of which $22.7 million was related to a net increase in deferred revenue and accounts receivable due to the growth in billing and the timing of collections, partially offset by a $1.1 million decrease in payables and accrued liabilities and a $3.4 million increase in prepaid expenses primarily driven by the timing of payments. In 2022, we generated $177.2 million of cash from our net income, as adjusted for non-cash items mainly related to stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expense and deferred taxes, as compared to $169.6 million in 2021. In addition, we also generated $21.7 million of cash from working capital change in 2022, of which $11.8 million was related to a net increase in deferred revenue and accounts receivable as a result of our continued growth in billing and the timing of collections, and $9.9 million was due to lower prepaid expenses and an increase in payables and accrued liabilities primarily due to timing of payments. [/671]
[644]: Income tax provision increased by $1.3 million in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to an increase in pretax income and a decrease in excess tax benefits arising from stock-based compensation compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was partially offset by higher foreign tax credits and lower net capitalization of research and development expenses for tax purposes than previously estimated, reflecting the rule change and the guidance. [/644]
[645]: Key Operating and Non-GAAP Financial Performance Metrics [/645]
[646]: In addition to measures of financial performance presented in our consolidated financial statements, we monitor the key metrics set forth below to help us evaluate growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and assess operational efficiencies. [/646]
[647]: Net Dollar Expansion Rate [/647]
[648]: We evaluate our ability to retain and grow existing customers by assessing our net dollar expansion rate on a last twelve months, or LTM, basis. This metric is used to appropriately manage resources and customer retention and expansion. We calculate the net dollar expansion rate on a foreign exchange neutral basis by dividing a numerator by a denominator, each defined as follows: [/648]
[600]: Operating Expenses [/600]
[601]: Research and Development [/601]
[602]: Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses, comprised of salaries, benefits, performance-based compensation and stock-based compensation, for our research and development teams. Other expenses include third-party contractor fees, software and license fees, amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions and overhead allocations. We expect to continue to devote resources to research and development in an effort to continuously improve our existing solutions as well as develop new solutions and capabilities and expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars. [/602]
[603]: Sales and Marketing [/603]
[604]: Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses, comprised of salaries, benefits, sales commissions, performance-based compensation and stock-based compensation for our worldwide sales and marketing teams. Other expenses include marketing and promotional events, lead-generation marketing programs, public relations, travel, software licenses and overhead allocations. Sales commissions related to new business and upsells are capitalized as an asset. We amortize the capitalized commission cost as a selling expense on a straight-line basis over a period of five years. We expense sales commissions related to contract renewals as incurred. Our new sales personnel are typically not immediately productive, and the resulting increase in sales and marketing expenses we incur when we add new personnel may not result in increased revenues if these new sales personnel fail to become productive. The timing of our hiring of sales personnel, or the participation in new marketing events or programs, and the rate at which these generate incremental revenues, may affect our future operating results. We expect to continue to invest in additional sales personnel worldwide and also in more marketing programs to support new solutions on our platform, which will increase sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars.

[792]: Costs related to software developed, acquired or modified for internal use are capitalized and included in other noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Costs incurred during the preliminary planning and evaluation stage of the project and during the post implementation stages of the project are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred during the application development stage of the project are capitalized. These capitalized costs consist of internal compensation related costs and external direct costs.   Costs related to software developed for internal use are amortized over an estimated useful life of three years and recorded in cost of revenues. Management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022 , unamortized balances related to the Company's internally developed software costs are immaterial. Asset Acquisitions and Business Combinations The Company applies the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, in accounting for its acquisitions. To determine whether transactions should be accounted for as asset acquisition or business combination, the Company evaluates whether substantially all of the fair value of gross assets included in a transaction is concentrated in a single asset (or a group of similar assets), resulting in an asset acquisition, if not, resulting in a business combination. In an asset acquisition, the cost of acquiring the asset group, including transaction costs, is allocated to the acquired assets or assumed liabilities based on their relative fair values without giving rise to goodwill. In a business combination, the Company recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration, where applicable, its estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company records adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to its consolidated statements of operations. Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instruments are utilized by the Company to reduce foreign currency exchange risks. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts, with maturities of 13 months or less, to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of certain non-U.S. dollar denominated net asset positions, to date primarily cash, accounts receivable and operating lease liabilities, as well as to manage foreign currency fluctuation risk related to forecasted transactions. Open contracts are recorded within prepaid expenses and other current assets, other noncurrent assets, accrued liabilities or other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses resulting from currency exchange rate movements on non-designated forward contracts are recognized in other income (expense), net. Any gains or losses from derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are first recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) and then reclassified into revenue or operating expenses when the hedged item impacts the consolidated statements of operations. Cash flows related to these forward contracts are classified in the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows in the same manner as the underlying hedged transaction within cash flows from operating activities. Stock-Based Compensation The Company recognizes the fair value of its stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and stock purchase rights under the ESPP on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods. The fair value of each stock option or stock purchase right is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model and the fair value of each RSU is based on the Company's common stock price on the date of grant. Compensation expenses for performance-based stock options (“PSOs”) and performance-based restricted stock units (“PSUs”) are recorded based on expected achievement of the performance metrics specified in the grant, which are assessed on a quarterly basis. Forfeitures are estimated on the date of grant and revised if actual or expected forfeiture materially differs from original estimates. [/792]

[337]: In our Application Software segment, net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $3,186.9 as compared to $2,639.5 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The growth of 5.9% in organic revenues was broad-based across the segment led by our businesses serving the government contracting, property and casualty insurance, acute healthcare, and legal markets. Gross margin remained relatively consistent at 68.9% for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 68.8% for the year ended December 31, 2022. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses as a percentage of net revenues in the year ended December 31, 2023 increased to 43.1%, as compared to 41.8% in the year ended December 31, 2022, due primarily to higher amortization of acquired intangibles from the acquisitions of Frontline and Syntellis and restructuring-related expenses incurred primarily in connection with the integration of the Syntellis acquisition. The resulting operating margin was 25.8% in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 27.1% in the year ended December 31, 2022. [/337]

Indicor – On November 22, 2022, Roper completed the divestiture of a majority 51 % stake in Indicor to CD&R for approximately $ 2,604 in cash. The consideration was comprised of a cash distribution of approximately $ 1,775 funded by third-party indebtedness incurred by Indicor and approximately $ 829 related to the majority 51 % equity stake. The Company retained an initial 49 % minority equity interest. The sale resulted in a pretax gain of $ 2,046.0 , which included $ 142.6 of foreign currency translation losses and $ 535.0 associated with the initial remaining 49 % interest in Indicor (described further in Note 10). The Company recognized income tax expense of $ 407.2 associated with the gain.

The amount for 2023 includes asset write-offs and related costs in connection with the discontinuance of an internally developed software project. [/1115]
[456]: We generate revenues from the following sources: (i) sales, consisting primarily of (1) Tim Hortons supply chain sales, which represent sales of products, supplies and restaurant equipment to franchisees, as well as sales of consumer packaged goods (“CPG”), and (2) sales at Company restaurants; (ii) franchise revenues, consisting primarily of royalties based on a percentage of sales reported by franchised restaurants and franchise fees paid by franchisees; (iii) property revenues from properties we lease or sublease to franchisees; and (iv) advertising revenues and other services, consisting primarily of (1) advertising fund contributions based on a percentage of sales reported by franchised restaurants to fund advertising expenses and (2) tech fees and revenues that vary by market and partially offset expenses related to technology initiatives.

[913]: Revenue Recognition Sales Sales consist primarily of supply chain sales, which represent sales of products, supplies and restaurant equipment to franchisees, as well as sales to retailers and direct to consumer and are presented net of any related sales tax. Orders placed by customers specify the goods to be delivered and transaction prices for supply chain sales. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control over ordered items, generally upon delivery to the customer, which is when the customer obtains physical possession of the goods, legal title is transferred, the customer has all risks and rewards of ownership and an obligation to pay for the goods is created. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight for supply chain sales are accounted for as fulfillment costs and classified as cost of sales. To a much lesser extent, sales also include Company restaurant sales (including Restaurant VIEs), which consist of sales to restaurant guests. Revenue from Company restaurant sales is recognized at the point of sale. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that we collect are excluded from revenue. Franchise and property revenues Franchise revenues consist primarily of royalties, initial and renewal franchise fees and upfront fees from development agreements and master franchise and development agreements (“MFDAs”). Under franchise agreements, we provide franchisees with (i) a franchise license, which includes a license to use our intellectual property, (ii) pre-opening services, such as training and inspections, and (iii) ongoing services, such as development of training materials and menu items and restaurant monitoring and inspections. These services are highly interrelated and dependent upon the franchise license and we concluded these services do not represent individually distinct performance obligations. Consequently, we bundle the franchise license performance obligation and promises to provide these services into a single performance obligation (the “Franchise PO”), which we satisfy by providing a right to use our intellectual property over the term of each franchise agreement. Royalties are calculated as a percentage of franchised restaurant sales over the term of the franchise agreement. Initial and renewal franchise fees are payable by the franchisee upon a new restaurant opening or renewal of an existing franchise agreement. Our franchise agreement royalties represent sales-based royalties that are related entirely to the Franchise PO and are recognized as franchise sales occur. Initial and renewal franchise fees are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective agreement. Our performance obligation under development agreements other than MFDAs generally consists of an obligation to grant exclusive development rights over a stated term. These development rights are not distinct from franchise agreements, so upfront fees paid by franchisees for exclusive development rights are deferred and apportioned to each franchised restaurant opened by the franchisee. The pro rata amount apportioned to each restaurant is accounted for as an initial franchise fee. [/913]

Non-GAAP financial measures either exclude or include amounts that are not reflected in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.

[623]: Advertising and Other Services [/623]
[624]: During 2023 and 2022, the increases in advertising revenues and other services were primarily driven by increases in advertising fund contributions by franchisees in the limited number of markets where we manage the advertising funds, as a result of increases in system-wide sales, and to a lesser extent an increase in tech revenues.

[626]: Segment G&A [/626]
[627]: During 2023 and 2022, the increases in Segment G&A were primarily driven by higher share-based compensation and non-cash incentive compensation as well as higher salary and employee-related costs for non-restaurant employees, largely a result of hiring across a number of key areas including operations and franchising.

[631]: The table below contains information regarding Adjusted Operating Income, which is a non-GAAP measure. This non-GAAP measure does not have a standardized meaning under U.S. GAAP and may differ from a similar captioned measure of other companies in our industry. We believe this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors in assessing our operating performance, as it provides them with the same tools that management uses to evaluate our performance and is responsive to questions we receive from both investors and analysts. By disclosing this non-GAAP measure, we intend to provide investors with a consistent comparison of our operating results and trends for the periods presented. Adjusted Operating Income is defined as income from operations excluding (i) franchise agreement amortization as a result of acquisition accounting, (ii) (income) loss from equity method investments, net of cash distributions received from equity method investments, (iii) other operating expenses (income), net and, (iv) income/expenses from non-recurring projects and non-operating activities. For the periods referenced, income/expenses from non-recurring projects and non-operating activities included (i) non-recurring fees and expense incurred in connection with the acquisition of Firehouse consisting of professional fees, compensation related expenses and integration costs; and (ii) non-operating costs from professional advisory and consulting services associated with certain transformational corporate restructuring initiatives that rationalize our structure and optimize cash movements as well as services related to significant tax reform legislation and regulations. Management believes that these types of expenses are either not related to our underlying profitability drivers or not likely to re-occur in the foreseeable future and the varied timing, size and nature of these projects may cause volatility in our results unrelated to the performance of our core business that does not reflect trends of our core operations.

Except for the following equity method investments, no quoted market prices are available for our other equity method investments. The aggregate market value of our 14.7 % equity interest in Carrols Restaurant Group, Inc. (“Carrols”) based on the quoted market price on December 31, 2023 is approximately $ 74 million. The aggregate market value of our 9.4 % equity interest in BK Brasil Operação e Assessoria a Restaurantes S.A. based on the quoted market price on December 31, 2023 is approximately $ 30 million. The aggregate market value of our 4.2 % equity interest in TH International Limited based on the quoted market price on December 31, 2023 was approximately $ 12 million. We evaluate declines in the market value of these equity method investments and as a result, during 2022, we recognized an impairment of $ 15 million due to a sustained decline in Carrols' share price and market capitalization.

[1161]: The Company identifies its segments according to how the chief operating decision maker evaluates financial performance and allocates resources. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the critical illness recovery hospital segment, rehabilitation hospital segment, outpatient rehabilitation segment, and Concentra segment. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. Other activities include the Company’s corporate shared services, certain investments, and employee leasing services provided to related parties affiliated through the Company’s equity method investments. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, the Company’s other activities also include other operating income related to the recognition of payments received under the Provider Relief Fund for health care related expenses and loss of revenue attributable to the coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”). Refer to Note 21 – CARES Act for further information. The Company evaluates the performance of its segments based on Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings excluding interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, gain (loss) on early retirement of debt, stock compensation expense, gain (loss) on sale of businesses, and equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated subsidiaries. The Company has provided additional information regarding its reportable segments, such as total assets, which contributes to the understanding of the Company and provides useful information to the users of the consolidated financial statements. [/1161]
[1207]: For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a net valuation allowance increase of $ 2.7 million. These changes resulted from net changes in state net operating losses. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a net valuation allowance decrease of $ 3.0 million. The changes in the Company’s valuation allowance were recognized as a result of management’s reassessment of the amount of its deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized. [/1207]
[1208]: F-33 [/1208]
[1209]: Table of Contents SELECT MEDICAL HOLDINGS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 18.     Income Taxes (Continued) [/1209]
[1210]: At December 31, 2022 and 2023, the Company’s net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $ 152.8 million and $ 122.2 million, respectively, consist of items which have been recognized for tax reporting purposes, but which will increase tax on returns to be filed in the future. The Company has performed an assessment of positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of the net deferred tax assets. This assessment included a review of legal entities with three years of cumulative losses, estimates of projected future taxable income, the effect on future taxable income resulting from the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities in future periods, and the impact of tax planning strategies that management would and could implement in order to keep deferred tax assets from expiring unused. Although realization is not assured, based on the Company’s assessment, it has concluded that it is more likely than not that such assets, net of the determined valuation allowance, will be realized. [/1210]

[1226]: 20. Commitments and Contingencies [/1226]
[1227]: Construction Commitments At December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding commitments under construction contracts related to new construction, improvements, and renovations totaling approximately $ 16.4 million. Litigation The Company is a party to various legal actions, proceedings, and claims (some of which are not insured), and regulatory and other governmental audits and investigations in the ordinary course of its business. The Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of pending litigation, proceedings, and regulatory and other governmental audits and investigations. These matters could potentially subject the Company to sanctions, damages, recoupments, fines, and other penalties. The Department of Justice, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), or other federal and state enforcement and regulatory agencies may conduct additional investigations related to the Company’s businesses in the future that may, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. To address claims arising out of the Company’s operations, the Company maintains professional malpractice liability insurance and general liability insurance coverages through a number of different programs that are dependent upon such factors as the state where the Company is operating and whether the operations are wholly owned or are operated through a joint venture. For the Company’s wholly owned hospital and outpatient clinic operations, the Company currently maintains insurance coverages under a combination of policies with a total annual aggregate limit of up to $ 37.0 million for professional malpractice liability insurance and $ 40.0 million for general liability insurance. For the Company’s Concentra center operations, the Company currently maintains insurance coverages under a combination of policies with a total annual aggregate limit of up to $ 29.0 million for professional malpractice liability insurance and $ 29.0 million for general liability insurance. The Company’s insurance for the professional liability coverage is written on a “claims-made” basis, and its commercial general liability coverage is maintained on an “occurrence” basis. These coverages apply after a self-insured retention limit is exceeded. For the Company’s joint venture operations, the Company has designed a separate insurance program that responds to the risks of specific joint ventures. Most of the Company’s joint ventures are insured under a master program with an annual aggregate limit of up to $ 80.0 million, subject to a sublimit aggregate ranging from $ 23.0 million to $ 33.0 million for most joint ventures. The policies are generally written on a “claims-made” basis. Each of these programs has either a deductible or self-insured retention limit. The Company also maintains additional types of liability insurance covering claims which, due to their nature or amount, are not covered by or not fully covered by the applicable professional malpractice and general liability insurance policies, including workers compensation, property and casualty, directors and officers, cyber liability insurance, and employment practices liability insurance coverages. Our insurance policies generally are silent with respect to punitive damages so coverage is available to the extent insurable under the law of any applicable jurisdiction,"

Recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies the performance obligations
 (row end);
 [/405]
[407]: Customer returns of non-conforming products are estimated at the time revenue is recognized. In certain customer relationships, volume rebates exist, which are recognized
      according to the terms and conditions of the contractual relationship. Customer returns, rebates, and discounts are not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Company has elected to recognize the revenue and cost for freight
      and shipping when control over the products has transferred to the customer. The Company has elected to immediately expense contract costs related to obtaining a contract as the amortization period of the asset the Company otherwise would have
      recognized would have been less than a year. [/407]
[408]: In addition to evaluating the Company’s performance based on the segments above, revenue is also disaggregated and analyzed by product line and geographic market (See Note
      12, Segment and Geographic Information, for further information) . [/408]

[586]: 12. Segment and Geographic Information [/586]
[587]: The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant
        accounting policies. The Company evaluates performance based on operating income before divestiture & other related costs and income, share-based compensation, restructuring and other charges, including operational improvement plan costs and
        income and portfolio optimization plan costs, interest expense, and income taxes (segment operating income). Total revenue and segment operating income by business segment and geographic region include both sales to customers, as reported in the
        Company’s Consolidated Statements of Earnings, and intersegment sales, which are accounted for at prices that approximate market prices and are eliminated in consolidation. [/587]
[588]: Assets by business segment and geographic region are those assets used in the Company’s operations in each segment and geographic region. Segment assets reflect the
      allocation of goodwill to each segment. Corporate & Other assets consist primarily of accounts receivables from the securitization program, investments, deferred tax assets, and fixed assets. [/588]
[395]: Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation [/395]
[396]: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
      States of America (GAAP). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. [/396]
[397]: Use of Estimates [/397]
[398]: The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the use of management’s estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
      revenue, and expenses during the reporting period and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. [/398]
[399]: Revenue Recognition [/399]
[400]: The Company recognizes revenue at the transfer of control of its products to the Company’s customers in an amount reflecting the consideration to which the Company expects
      to be entitled. In order to achieve this core principle, the Company applies the following five-step approach: [/400]
[358]: The Company is the purchaser of certain commodities, such as vanilla, corn, sugar, soybean meal, and fruits. The Company generally purchases these commodities based upon market prices that are established with the vendor
        as part of the purchase process. In general, the Company does not use commodity financial instruments to hedge commodity prices due to a high correlation between the commodity cost and the ultimate selling price of the Company’s products. On
        occasion, the Company may enter into non-cancelable forward purchase contracts, as deemed appropriate, to reduce the effect of price fluctuations on future manufacturing requirements. [/358]

The estimated fair values for
      the inks and fragrances (excluding its essential oils product line) product lines were determined based on indicative bids, which are classified as Level 3 inputs in the fair value measurement hierarchy. The Company recorded non-cash charges in Cost of Products Sold during the year ended December 31, 2021, to reduce the carrying value of certain inventories, when they were determined to be excess. The
      Company recorded a non-cash loss during the year ended December 31, 2021, related to the reclassification of foreign currency translation and related items from Accumulated





















        Other Comprehensive Loss to Selling and Administrative Expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. [/616]
[48]: Description of Business [/48]
[49]: The Company is a leading global manufacturer and marketer of colors, flavors, and other specialty ingredients. The Company uses advanced technologies and robust global supply chain capabilities to develop specialized
        solutions for food and beverages, as well as products that serve the pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and personal care industries. The Company’s customers range in size from small entrepreneurial businesses to major international manufacturers
        representing some of the world’s best-known brands. [/49]
[50]: The Company’s principal products include: [/50]
[58]: For 2023, the Company’s three reportable segments were the Flavors & Extracts Group and the Color Group, which are managed on a product line basis, and the Asia Pacific Group, which is managed on a geographic basis.
        The Company’s corporate expenses, divestiture & other related costs and income, share-based compensation, restructuring and other charges, including operational improvement plan costs and income and portfolio optimization plan costs, and
        certain other costs are included in the “Corporate & Other” category as described in this report. Financial information regarding the Company’s three reportable segments and the operations included within Corporate & Other is set forth in
        Note 12, Segment and Geographic Information , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. [/58]
[296]: See Note 16, Portfolio Optimization Plan , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this
        report for additional information. [/296]
[297]: NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES [/297]
[298]: Within the following tables, the Company reports certain non-GAAP financial measures, including: (1) adjusted operating income, adjusted net earnings, and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which exclude the divestiture
        & other related income and restructuring and other costs, including the portfolio optimization plan costs and (2) percentage changes in revenue, operating income, and diluted earnings per share on an adjusted local currency basis, which
        eliminate the effects that result from translating its international operations into U.S. dollars, the divestiture & other related income, and restructuring and other costs, including the portfolio optimization plan costs. [/298]
[299]: The Company has included each of these non-GAAP measures in order to provide additional information regarding our underlying operating results and comparable year-over-year performance. Such information is supplemental to
        information presented in accordance with GAAP and is not intended to represent a presentation in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation. Rather, they should be considered together with GAAP measures and
        the rest of the information included in this report. Management internally reviews each of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate performance on a comparative period-to-period basis and to gain additional insight into underlying operating and
        performance trends, and the Company believes the information can be beneficial to investors for the same purposes. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. [/299]
[267]: The Company’s diluted earnings per share were $2.21 in 2023 and $3.34 in 2022. 2023 results were negatively impacted by $27.8 million ($27.4 million after tax, $0.65 per share) of portfolio optimization plan costs. 2022
        results were positively impacted by $2.5 million ($1.9 million after tax, $0.04 per share) of divestiture & other related income. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, which exclude the divestiture & other related income and the portfolio
        optimization plan costs, were $2.86 in 2023 and $3.29 in 2022 (see discussion below regarding non-GAAP financial measures). [/267]

[269]: RESULTS OF OPERATIONS [/269]
[270]: 2023 vs. 2022 [/270]
[271]: Revenue [/271]
[272]: Sensient’s revenue was approximately $1.46 billion and $1.44 billion in 2023 and 2022, respectively. [/272]
[273]: Gross Profit [/273]
[274]: The Company’s gross margin was 31.6% in 2023 and 34.0% in 2022. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to higher raw material costs, lower volumes, and portfolio optimization plan costs, which decreased gross
        margin 20 basis points in 2023, partially offset by higher selling prices in 2023. [/274]
[38]: NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES [/38]
[39]: Within this document, the Company reports certain non-GAAP financial measures, including: (1) adjusted operating income, adjusted net earnings, and adjusted diluted earnings per share (which exclude divestiture &
        other related income and restructuring and other costs, which include portfolio optimization plan costs) and (2) percentage changes in revenue, operating income, and diluted earnings per share on an adjusted local currency basis (which eliminate
        the effects that result from translating its international operations into U.S. dollars, divestiture & other related income, and restructuring and other costs, which include portfolio optimization plan costs). The Company has included each of

[329]: Cash Flows from Operating Activities [/329]
[330]: Net cash provided by operating activities was $169.7 million and $12.1 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Operating cash flow provided the primary source of funds for operating needs, capital expenditures, and
        shareholder dividends. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in the cash used for inventory investments during 2023 compared to 2022 and an increase in cash provided by accounts
        receivable. [/330]
[331]: Cash Flows from Investing Activities [/331]
[332]: Net cash used in investing activities was $87.6 million and $98.4 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Capital expenditures were $87.9 million in 2023 and $79.3 million in 2022. In 2022, the Company received $2.5
          million of proceeds from the divestiture of the yogurt fruit preparations product line. The Company paid $1.7 million and $21.7 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively, for the acquisition of Endemix Doğal

[451]: The Company has a share-based compensation plan under which employees may be granted share-based awards in which non-forfeitable dividends are paid on non-vested shares for
      certain awards. As such, these shares are considered participating securities under the two-class method of calculating EPS as described in ASC 260, Earnings per
        Share. The two-class method of calculating EPS did not have a material impact on the Company’s EPS calculations as of December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021. [/451]

Description 
of the Matter
 (col 1): 
 As described in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, at December 31, 2023, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $117.4 million,
 $59.6 million of which relate to net operating losses (NOLs), foreign tax credits and other tax credits reduced by a $34.1 million valuation allowance. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based
 upon the weight of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
 

Management’s analysis of the realizability of its deferred tax assets related to NOLs, foreign tax credits and other tax credits was significant to our audit because the amounts are
 material to the financial statements and the assessment process related to the realizability of these deferred tax assets is complex, and involves significant judgments that include projections of income, sources of
 income and tax planning strategies

 (row end);
 [/651]
[411]: Cost of products sold includes materials, labor, and overhead expenses incurred in the manufacture of our products. Cost of products sold also includes charges for obsolete
      and slow-moving inventories as well as costs for quality control, purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs, warehousing costs, internal transfer costs, other costs of our internal distribution network, and costs incurred for shipping and
      handling. The Company records fees billed to customers for shipping and handling as revenue. [/411]
[412]: Selling and Administrative Expenses [/412]
[413]: Selling and administrative expenses primarily include the salaries and related costs for executive, finance, accounting, human resources, information technology, research
      and development, and legal personnel as well as salaries and related costs of salespersons and commissions paid to external sales agents. [/413]
[414]: Cash Equivalents [/414]
[415]: The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition as cash equivalents. [/415]
[100]: The Company believes that its ability to reformulate its products and the general availability of alternate sources of materials from different geographic areas would generally enable it to maintain its competitive
        position in the event of an interruption in the supply of raw materials from a single supplier. [/100]
[101]: Competition [/101]
[102]: All Company products are sold in highly competitive markets. While no single factor is determinative, the Company’s competitive position is based principally on process and applications expertise, quality, technological
        advances resulting from its research and development, and customer service and support. Because of its highly differentiated products, the Company competes with only a few companies across multiple product lines and generally encounters different
        competitors in different product lines. [/102]
[106]: Foreign Operations [/106]
[107]: Additional information regarding the Company’s foreign operations is set forth in Note 12, Segment and Geographic Information , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
        included in this report. [/107]
[333]: Cash Flows from Financing Activities [/333]
[334]: Net cash used in financing activities was $82.0 million in 2023, and net cash provided by financing activities was $86.2 million in 2022. The Company had a net decrease in debt of $3.5 million in 2023 compared to a net
        increase in debt of $157.2 million in 2022. For the purposes of the cash flow statement, net changes in debt exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates. The Company has paid uninterrupted quarterly cash dividends since commencing public trading
        of its stock in 1962. Dividends paid per share were $1.64 in 2023 and 2022. Total dividends paid were $69.2 million and $68.9 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. [/334]
[335]: CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES [/335]
[336]: In preparing the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., management is required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the asset, liability, revenue,
        and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosures of the Company, including information about contingencies, risk, and financial condition. The Company believes, given current facts and
        circumstances, that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable, adhere to accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., and are consistently applied. Inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may
        differ from estimates and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise. The Company makes routine estimates and judgments in determining the net realizable value of accounts receivable, inventories, and property, plant, and equipment.
        Management believes the Company’s most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas: [/336]
[594]: Table element - Text before table: The Company’s three reportable segments are Flavors & Extracts and Color segments, which are both managed on a product line basis, and the Asia Pacific segment, which is managed on a geographic basis. The Company’s Flavors & Extracts
      segment produces flavor, extracts, and essential oils products that impart a desired taste, texture, aroma, or other characteristic to a broad range of consumer and other products. The Color segment produces natural and synthetic color systems for

      costs and income and portfolio optimization plan costs, and certain other costs are included in the “Corporate & Other” category.

[860]: Note 2 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers [/860]
[861]: The Company recognizes its share of revenue from the sale of produced oil, gas, and NGLs from its Midland Basin and South Texas assets.  Oil, gas, and NGL production revenue presented within the accompanying statements of operations reflects revenue generated from contracts with customers. [/861]
[862]: The tables below present oil, gas, and NGL production revenue by product type for each of the Company’s operating areas for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021: [/862]
[866]: The Company recognizes oil, gas, and NGL production revenue at the point in time when control of the product transfers to the purchaser, which may differ depending on the applicable contractual terms.  Transfer of control determines the presentation of transportation, gathering, processing, and other post-production expenses (“fees and other deductions”) within the accompanying statements of operations.  Fees and other deductions incurred by the Company prior to transfer of control are recorded within the oil, gas, and NGL production expense line item on the accompanying statements of operations.  When control is transferred at or near the wellhead, sales are based on a wellhead market price that may be affected by fees and other deductions incurred by the purchaser subsequent to the transfer of control.  In general, the Company generates production revenue from a combination of the following types of contracts: [/866]
[95]: OPIS .  Oil Price Information Service, a common industry benchmark for NGL pricing at Mont Belvieu, Texas. [/95]
[96]: PV-10. PV-10 is a non-GAAP measure.  The present value of estimated future revenue to be generated from the production of estimated proved reserves, net of estimated production and future development costs, based on prices used in estimating the proved reserves and costs in effect as of the date indicated (unless such costs are subject to change pursuant to contractual provisions), without giving effect to non-property related expenses such as general and administrative expenses, debt service, future income tax expenses, or depreciation, depletion, and amortization, discounted using an annual discount rate of 10 percent.  While this measure does not include the effect of income taxes as it would in the use of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows calculation, it does provide an indicative representation of the relative value of the Company on a comparative basis to other companies and from period to period.  This measure is presented because management believes it provides useful information to investors for analysis of the Company's fundamental business on a recurring basis. [/96]
[734]: Our discussion of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the information reported in our consolidated financial statements.  The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our consolidated financial statements.  We base our assumptions and estimates on historical experience and various other sources that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Actual results may differ from the estimates we calculate as a result of changes in circumstances, global economics and politics, and general business conditions.  A summary of our significant accounting policies is detailed in Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this report.  We have outlined below, those policies identified as being critical to the understanding of our business and results of operations and that require the application of significant management judgment. [/734]
[853]: 68 [/853]
[854]: Please refer to Note 8 – Fair Value Measurements for additional information. Other Property and Equipment Other property and equipment such as facilities, equipment inventory, office furniture and equipment, buildings, and computer hardware and software are recorded at cost.  The Company capitalizes certain software costs incurred during the application development stage.  The application development stage generally includes software design, configuration, testing, and installation activities.  Costs of renewals and improvements that substantially extend the useful lives of the assets are capitalized.  Maintenance and repair costs are expensed when incurred.  Depreciation is calculated using either the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to 30 years, or the unit of output method when appropriate.  When other property and equipment is sold or retired, the capitalized costs and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the Company’s accounts. Facilities and equipment inventory costs are evaluated for impairment and reduced to fair value when there is an indication the carrying costs may not be recoverable.  To measure the fair value of facilities and equipment inventory, the Company uses an income valuation technique or market approach depending on the quality of information available to support management’s assumptions and the circumstances.  For facilities, the valuation includes consideration of the proved and unproved assets supported by the facilities, future cash flows associated with the assets, and fixed costs necessary to operate and maintain the assets. Asset Retirement Obligations The Company recognizes an estimated liability for future costs associated with the abandonment of its oil and gas properties, including facilities requiring decommissioning.  A liability for the fair value of an asset retirement obligation and corresponding increase to the carrying value of the related long-lived asset are recorded at the time a well is drilled or acquired, or a facility is constructed.  The increase in carrying value is included in the proved oil and gas properties line item in the accompanying balance sheets.  The Company depletes the amount added to proved oil and gas property costs and recognizes expense in connection with the accretion of the discounted liability over the remaining estimated economic lives of the respective long-lived assets.  Cash paid to settle asset retirement obligations is included in the cash flows from operating activities section of the accompanying statements of cash flows. The Company’s estimated asset retirement obligation liability is based on historical experience in plugging and abandoning wells, estimated economic lives, estimated plugging and abandonment cost, and federal and state regulatory requirements.  The liability is discounted using the credit-adjusted risk-free rate estimated at the time the liability is incurred or revised.  The credit-adjusted risk-free rates used to discount the Company’s plugging and abandonment liabilities range from 5.5 percent to 12 percent.  In periods subsequent to initial measurement of the liability, the Company must recognize period-to-period changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time, revisions to either the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows or economic life, changes in inflation factors, or the Company’s credit-adjusted risk-free rate as market conditions warrant.  Please refer to Note 14 – Asset Retirement Obligations for a reconciliation of the Company’s total asset retirement obligation liability as of December 31, 2023, and 2022. Derivative Financial Instruments The Company periodically enters into commodity derivative instruments to mitigate a portion of its exposure to oil, gas, and NGL price volatility and location differentials for its expected future oil, gas, and NGL production, and the associated effect on cash flows.  These instruments typically include commodity price swaps and collar arrangements, as well as, basis swaps and roll differential swaps.  Commodity derivative instruments are measured at fair value and are included in the accompanying balance sheets as derivative assets and liabilities, with the exception of derivative instruments that meet the “normal purchase normal sale” exclusion.  The Company does not designate its commodity derivative contracts as hedging instruments.  Accordingly, the Company reflects changes in the fair value of its derivative instruments in its accompanying statements of operations as they occur.  Gains and losses on net derivative settlements are included within the cash flows from operating activities section of the accompanying statements of cash flows.  Please refer to Note 7 – Derivative Financial Instruments for additional discussion. Revenue Recognition The Company derives revenue predominately from the sale of produced oil, gas, and NGLs.  Revenue is recognized at the point in time when custody and title (“control”) of the product transfers to the purchaser, which may differ depending on the applicable contractual terms.  Revenue accruals are recorded monthly and are based on estimated production delivered to a purchaser and the expected price to be received.  The Company uses knowledge of its properties, contractual arrangements, historical performance, NYMEX, local spot market, and OPIS prices, and other factors as the basis of these estimates.  Variances between estimates and the actual amounts received are recorded in the month payment is received.  Please refer to Note 2 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers for additional discussion.

[844]: Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of proved oil and gas reserves, assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Estimates of proved oil and gas reserve quantities provide the basis for the calculation of DD&A expense, impairment of proved and unproved oil and gas properties, and asset retirement obligations, each of which represents a significant component of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. [/844]
[845]: Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all liquid investments purchased with an initial maturity of three months or less and deposits in money market mutual funds that are readily convertible into cash to be cash equivalents.  The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. [/845]
[961]: The following table is a listing of the Company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in the accompanying balance sheets and where they are classified within the fair value hierarchy: [/961]
[963]: ____________________________________________ [/963]
[964]: (1) This represents a financial asset or liability that is measured at fair value on a recurring basis. [/964]
[965]: 84 [/965]
[966]: Both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities are categorized within the above fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used by the Company as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the above fair value hierarchy.  Please refer to Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information on the Company’s policies for determining fair value for the categories discussed below. Derivatives The Company uses Level 2 inputs to measure the fair value of oil, gas, and NGL commodity derivative instruments.  Fair values are based upon interpolated data.  The Company derives internal valuation estimates taking into consideration forward commodity price curves, counterparties’ credit ratings, the Company’s credit rating, and the time value of money.  These valuations are then compared to the respective counterparties’ mark-to-market statements.  The considered factors result in an estimated exit price that management believes provides a reasonable and consistent methodology for valuing derivative instruments.  The commodity derivative instruments utilized by the Company are not considered by management to be complex, structured, or illiquid.  The oil, gas, and NGL commodity derivative markets are highly active. Generally, market quotes assume that all counterparties have near zero, or low, default rates and have equal credit quality.  However, an adjustment may be necessary to reflect the credit quality of a specific counterparty to determine the fair value of the instrument.  The Company monitors the credit ratings of its counterparties and may require counterparties to post collateral if their ratings deteriorate.  In some instances, the Company will attempt to novate the trade to a more stable counterparty. Valuation adjustments are necessary to reflect the effect of the Company’s credit quality on the fair value of any commodity derivative liability position.  This adjustment takes into account any credit enhancements, such as collateral margin that the Company may have posted with a counterparty, as well as any letters of credit between the parties.  The methodology to determine this adjustment is consistent with how the Company evaluates counterparty credit risk, taking into account the Company’s credit rating, current revolving credit facility margins, and any change in such margins since the last measurement date. The methods described above may result in a fair value estimate that may not be indicative of net realizable value or may not be reflective of future fair values and cash flows.  While the Company believes that the valuation methods utilized are appropriate and consistent with authoritative accounting guidance and other marketplace participants, the Company recognizes that third parties may use different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments that could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Please refer to Note 7 – Derivative Financial Instruments for more information regarding the Company’s derivative instruments. Oil and Gas Properties and Other Property and Equipment The Company had no assets included in total property and equipment, net, measured at fair value as of December 31, 2023, or 2022. No impairment expense was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2023.  Impairment expense for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, was $ 7.5 million and $ 35.0 million, respectively, and consisted of unproved property abandonments and impairments related to actual and anticipated lease expirations, as well as actual and anticipated losses on acreage due to title defects, changes in development plans, and other inherent acreage risks.  The balances in the unproved oil and gas properties line item on the accompanying balance sheets as of December 31, 2023, and 2022, are recorded at carrying value.  Please refer to Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for information on the Company’s policies for determining fair value of its oil and gas producing properties and related impairment expense. [/966]
[629]: Table element - Text before table: Note: Amounts may not calculate due to rounding.
Average net daily equivalent production volumes for the year ended December 31, 2023, increased five percent compared with 2022, comprised of a 20 percent increase from our South Texas assets, partially offset by a seven percent decrease from our Midland Basin assets.  As a result of decreases in benchmark commodity prices, realized prices for oil, gas, and NGLs decreased 19 percent, 61 percent, and 35 percent, respectively, resulting in a 29 percent decrease in oil, gas, and NGL production revenue.  Oil, gas, and NGL production expense for the year ended December 31, 2023, decreased nine percent, compared with 2022, primarily driven by decreases in production taxes and transportation costs, partially offset by an increase in LOE.

[735]: Successful Efforts Method of Accounting. GAAP provides two alternative methods for the oil and gas industry to use in accounting for oil and gas producing activities.  These two methods are generally known in our industry as the full cost method and the successful efforts method, and both methods are widely used.  The methods are different enough that in many circumstances the same set of facts will provide materially different financial statement results within a given year.  We have chosen the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities.  A more detailed description is included in Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Part II, Item 8 of this report. [/735]
[736]: Oil and Gas Reserve Quantities. Our estimated proved reserve quantities and future net cash flows are critical to understanding the value of our business.  They are used in comparative financial ratios and are the basis for significant accounting estimates in our consolidated financial statements, including the calculations of DD&A expense, impairment of proved and unproved oil and gas properties, and asset retirement obligations.  Please refer to Oil and Gas Producing Activities in Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional discussion on our accounting policies impacted by estimated reserve quantities.

[787]: To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of SM Energy Company [/787]
[788]: Opinion on the Financial Statements [/788]
[789]: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of SM Energy Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. [/789]
[552]: We recorded a net derivative gain of $68.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to a net derivative loss of $374.0 million for 2022.  These amounts include a net derivative settlement gain of $26.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, and a net derivative settlement loss of $710.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. [/552]
[553]: Operational activities during the year ended December 31, 2023, resulted in the following: [/553]
[554]: • Net cash provided by operating activities of $1.6 billion, compared with $1.7 billion for 2022. [/554]
[555]: • Net income of $817.9 million, or $6.86 per diluted share, compared with net income of $1.1 billion, or $8.96 per diluted share for 2022. [/555]
[556]: • Adjusted EBITDAX, a non-GAAP financial measure, of $1.7 billion, compared with $1.9 billion for 2022.  Please refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for additional discussion, including our definition of adjusted EBITDAX and reconciliations to net income and net cash provided by operating activities. [/556]
[557]: • Total estimated net proved reserves as of December 31, 2023, increased 13 percent from December 31, 2022, to 604.9 MMBOE, of which, 58 percent were liquids (oil and NGLs) and 56 percent were proved developed reserves.  The increase primarily consisted of revisions of previous estimates of 113.9 MMBOE related to infill reserves in both our South Texas and Midland Basin programs, partially offset by 55.5 MMBOE of production during 2023.  Our proved reserve life index increased to 10.9 years as of December 31, 2023, compared with 10.1 years as of December 31, 2022.  Please refer to Reserves in Part I, Items 1 and 2 of this report for additional discussion.  The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows was $6.3 billion as of December 31, 2023, compared with $10.0 billion as of December 31, 2022, which was a decrease of 37 percent year-over-year primarily driven by decreases in benchmark commodity prices during 2023.  Please refer to Supplemental Oil and Gas Information (unaudited) in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional discussion. [/557]

[276]: Risks Related to Our Business [/276]
[277]: Historically, we have incurred operating and net losses and we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability in the future. [/277]
[278]: We incurred operating losses of $243.4 million, $81.5 million and $54.9 million and net losses of $502.4 million, $130.3 million and $147.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These historical operating and net losses were due to a number of factors, including increased expenses to fund our growth and related financing needs. We expect to incur significant expenses as we finance the expansion of our operations and implement additional internal systems and infrastructure to support our growth and operations. We do not know whether our revenue will grow rapidly enough to absorb these costs. Our ability to achieve profitability depends on a number of factors, including: [/278]
[279]: •    growing our customer base and originating new customer agreements on economic terms; [/279]
[280]: •    maintaining or lowering our cost of capital; [/280]
[953]: Cost of Revenue—Depreciation [/953]
[955]: Cost of revenue—depreciation increased by $34.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the weighted average number of systems (excluding systems with loan agreements, service-only agreements and cash sales) from approximately 128,300 for the year ended December 31, 2022 to approximately 168,500 for the year ended December 31, 2023. On a weighted average number of systems basis, cost of revenue—depreciation remained relatively flat at $750 per system for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $773 per system for the same period in 2023 (3% increase). [/955]
[956]: Cost of Revenue—Inventory Sales [/956]
[958]: Cost of revenue—inventory sales decreased by $1.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was due to our dealers having sufficient inventory on hand from prior purchases. [/958]
[959]: Cost of Revenue—Other [/959]
[961]: Cost of revenue—other increased by $68.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily due to costs related to direct sales revenue of $41.8 million, costs related to cash sales revenue of $13.9 million and costs related to services of $9.1 million. [/961]

[1216]: Revenue [/1216]
[1217]: The following table presents the detail of revenue as recorded in the consolidated statements of operations: [/1217]
[1219]: We recognize revenue from contracts with customers as we satisfy our performance obligations at a transaction price reflecting an amount of consideration based upon an estimated rate of return, net of cash incentives. We express this rate of return as the solar rate per kilowatt hour (""kWh"") in the customer contract. The amount of revenue we recognize does not equal customer cash payments because we satisfy performance obligations ahead of cash receipt or evenly as we provide continuous access on a stand-ready basis to the solar energy system. We reflect the differences between revenue recognition and cash payments received in accounts receivable, other assets or deferred revenue, as appropriate. Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue we have not yet recognized and includes deferred revenue as well as amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. Contracted but not yet recognized revenue was approximately $ 5.4 billion as of December 31, 2023, of which we expect to recognize approximately 4 % over the next 12 months. We do not expect the annual recognition to vary significantly over approximately the next 20 years as the vast majority of existing customer agreements have at least 20 years remaining , given the average age of the fleet of solar energy systems under contract is less than four years . Certain customers may receive cash incentives. We defer recognition of the payment of these cash incentives and recognize them over the life of the contract as a reduction to revenue. The deferred payment is recorded in other assets for customers who receive the cash incentives under our lease and PPA agreements, and as a contra-liability in other long-term liabilities for customers who receive the cash incentives under our loan agreements. PPAs. Customers purchase electricity from us under PPAs. Pursuant to ASC 606, we recognize revenue based upon the amount of electricity delivered as determined by remote monitoring equipment at solar rates specified under the PPAs. All customers must pass our credit evaluation process. The PPAs generally have a term of 20 or 25 years with an opportunity for customers to renew for up to an additional 10 years, via two five-year or one 10-year renewal options. Leases .    We are the lessor under lease agreements for solar energy systems and energy storage systems, which do not meet the definition of a lease under ASC 842 and are accounted for as contracts with customers under ASC 606. We recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over the contract term as we satisfy our obligation to provide continuous access to the solar energy system. All customers must pass our credit evaluation process. The lease agreements generally have a term of 20 or 25 years with an opportunity for customers to renew for up to an additional 10 years, via two five-year or one 10-year renewal options. In most cases, we provide customers under our lease agreements a performance guarantee that each solar energy system will achieve a certain specified minimum solar energy production output, which is a significant proportion of its expected output. The specified minimum solar energy production output may not be achieved due to natural fluctuations in the weather or equipment failures from exposure and wear and tear outside of our control, among other factors. We determine the amount of the guaranteed output based on a number of different factors, including: (a) the specific site information related to the tilt of the panels, azimuth (a horizontal angle measured clockwise in degrees from a reference direction) of the panels, size of the system, and shading on site; (b) the calculated amount of available irradiance (amount of energy for a given flat surface facing a specific [/1219]

[1234]: estimated useful lives. Upon disposition, the cost and related accumulated depreciation of the assets are removed from property and equipment and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. [/1234]
[1235]: Acquisitions Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations , as amended by Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") No. 2017-01, Business Combinations: Clarifying the Definition of a Business . The purchase price of an acquisition is measured at the estimated fair value of the assets acquired, equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Any noncontrolling interests acquired are also initially measured at fair value. Costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred to general and administrative expense. We recognize goodwill if the aggregate fair value of the total purchase consideration and the noncontrolling interests is in excess of the aggregate fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We may engage third-party valuation firms to assist in determining the fair values. The operating results of an acquired business are included in our results of operations from the date of acquisition. We have up to one year from the acquisition date to complete the fair value purchase price allocation. See Note 12, Acquisitions. Asset acquisitions are measured based on the cost to us, including transaction costs. Asset acquisition costs, or the consideration transferred by us, are assumed to be equal to the fair value of the net assets acquired. If the consideration transferred is cash, measurement is based on the amount of cash we paid to the seller, as well as transaction costs incurred. Consideration given in the form of non-monetary assets, liabilities incurred or equity instruments issued is measured based on either the cost to us or the fair value of the assets or net assets acquired, whichever is more clearly evident. The cost of an asset acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. Goodwill is not recognized in an asset acquisition. [/1235]
[1226]: Deferred revenue consists of amounts for which the criteria for revenue recognition have not yet been met and includes (a) payments for unfulfilled performance obligations that will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the respective customer agreements, net of any cash incentives earned by the customers, (b) down payments and partial or full prepayments from customers and (c) differences due to the timing of energy production versus billing for certain types of PPAs. Deferred revenue was $ 297.8 million as of December 31, 2021. The following table presents the detail of deferred revenue as recorded in other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets: [/1226]
[1228]: (1) Of this amount, $ 50.8 million and $ 30.2 million is recorded in other current liabilities as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. [/1228]
[1229]: 109 [/1229]
[1230]: Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS [/1230]
[1231]: During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recognized revenue of $ 33.0 million and $ 16.0 million, respectively, from amounts recorded in deferred revenue at the beginning of the respective years. Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities Billing practices are governed by the contract terms of each project based upon costs incurred, production or predetermined schedules. Billings do not necessarily correlate with revenue recognized using the percentage-of-completion method to reflect the transfer of control over time. Contract assets include unbilled amounts typically resulting from revenue under contracts when the percentage-of-completion method of revenue recognition is utilized and revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer. Contract liabilities consist of advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized. Retainage, included in contract assets, represents the amounts withheld from billings by our clients pursuant to provisions in the contracts and may not be paid to us until the completion of specific tasks or the completion of the project and, in some instances, for even longer periods. Retainage may also be subject to restrictive conditions such as performance guarantees. Our contract assets and liabilities are reported in a net position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. The payment terms of our contracts from time to time require the customer to make advance payments as well as interim payments as work progresses. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, contract assets were $ 279,000 and $ 0 , respectively, and contract liabilities were $ 3.8 million and $ 0 , respectively. The increase in contract assets was primarily attributed to revenue recognized on certain contracts partially offset by the timing of billings. The increase in contract liabilities was due to the timing of advance payments partially offset by revenue recognized during the period. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recognized revenue of $ 0 from amounts recorded in contract liabilities at the beginning of the respective years. Performance Guarantee Obligations In most cases, we guarantee certain specified minimum solar energy production output under our leases and loan agreements, generally over a term between 10 and 25 years. The amounts are generally measured and credited to the customer's account as early as the first anniversary of the solar energy system's placed in service date and then every annual period thereafter. We monitor the solar energy systems to ensure these outputs are achieved. We evaluate if any amounts are due to our customers based upon not meeting the guaranteed solar energy production outputs at each reporting period end. For leases, these estimated amounts are recorded as a reduction to revenues from customers and a current or long-term liability, as applicable. For loans, these estimated amounts are recorded as an increase to cost of revenue—other and a current or long-term liability, as applicable. See Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies. Property and Equipment Solar Energy Systems and Energy Storage Systems. Depreciation and amortization of solar energy systems and energy storage systems are calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the solar energy systems and energy storage systems and are recorded in cost of revenue—depreciation. While solar energy systems and energy storage systems are in the design, construction and installation stages prior to being placed in service, the development of the systems is accounted for through construction in progress. The components of the design, construction and installation of the solar energy systems and energy storage systems are as follows: • Dealer's costs (engineering, procurement and construction) • Direct costs (costs directly related to a solar energy system or energy storage system) • Indirect costs (costs incurred in the design, construction and installation of the solar energy system or energy storage system but not directly associated with a particular asset) Solar energy systems and energy storage systems are carried at the cost of acquisition or construction (including design and installation) less certain utility rebates and are depreciated over the useful lives of the assets. Depreciation begins when a solar energy system or energy storage system is placed in service. Costs associated with repair and maintenance of a solar energy system or energy storage system are expensed as incurred. Costs associated with improvements to a solar energy system or energy storage system, which extend the life, increase the capacity or improve the efficiency of the systems, are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining life of the asset. Property and Equipment, Excluding Solar Energy Systems and Energy Storage Systems .    Property and equipment, including information technology system projects, computers and equipment, leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, vehicles and other property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets and are recorded in general and administrative expense. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the [/1231]
[927]: Other Revenue. Other revenue includes certain state and utility incentives. We recognize revenue from state and utility incentives in the periods in which they are earned. [/927]
[928]: Cost of Revenue—Depreciation. Cost of revenue—depreciation represents depreciation on solar energy systems under lease agreements and PPAs that have been placed in service. [/928]
[929]: Cost of Revenue—Inventory Sales. Cost of revenue—inventory sales represents costs related to the procurement and direct sale of inventory to our dealers or other parties, including shipping and handling costs. [/929]
[930]: Cost of Revenue—Other. Cost of revenue—other represents costs related to cash sales, costs to purchase SRECs on the open market, SREC broker fees, payroll and related costs for Sunnova personnel who install solar energy systems and energy storage systems and other items deemed to be a cost of providing the service of selling power to customers or potential customers, such as certain costs to service loan agreements, costs for filing under the Uniform Commercial Code to maintain title, title searches, credit checks on potential customers at the time of initial contract and other similar costs, typically directly related to the volume of customers and potential customers.

[862]: Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied. The majority of the Company's contracts have a single performance obligation to transfer products. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer, generally at the time of shipment of products. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring products and is generally based upon a negotiated, formula, list or fixed price. The Company sells its products both directly to customers and through distributors generally under agreements with payment terms typically less than 90 days. The Company has elected to account for shipping and handling as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the good. As such, shipping and handling fees billed to customers in a sales transaction are recorded in Net sales and shipping and handling costs incurred are recorded in Cost of sales. The Company has elected to exclude from Net sales any value add, sales and other taxes which it collects concurrent with revenue-producing activities. • Contract Estimates The nature of certain of the Company's contracts gives rise to variable consideration, which may be constrained, including retrospective volume-based rebates to certain customers. The Company issues retrospective volume-based rebates to customers when they purchase a certain volume level, and the rebates are applied retroactively to prior purchases. The Company also issues prospective volume-based rebates to customers when they purchase a certain volume level, and the rebates are applied to future purchases. Prospective volume-based rebates represent a material right within the contract and therefore are considered to be separate performance obligations. For both retrospective and prospective volume-based rebates, the Company estimates the level of volumes based on anticipated purchases at the beginning of the period and records a rebate accrual for each purchase toward the requisite rebate volume. These estimated rebates, which are reassessed each reporting period, are included in the transaction price of the Company's contracts with customers as a reduction to Net sales and are included in Current Other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets ( Note 10 ). The majority of the Company's revenue is derived from contracts (i) with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which it recognizes revenue at the amount in which it has the right to invoice as product is delivered. The Company has elected the practical expedient not to disclose the value of remaining performance obligations associated with these types of contracts. However, the Company has certain contracts that represent take-or-pay revenue arrangements in which the Company's performance obligations extend over multiple years. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $ 1.2 billion of remaining performance obligations related to take-or-pay contracts. The Company expects to recognize approximately $ 446 million of its remaining performance obligations as Net sales in 2024, $ 398 million in 2025, $ 152 million in 2026 and the balance thereafter. The Company has certain contracts which contain performance obligations which are immaterial in the context of the contract with the customer. The Company has elected the practical expedient not to assess whether these promised goods or services are performance obligations. • Contract Balances Contract liabilities primarily relate to advances or deposits received from the Company's customers before revenue is recognized. These amounts are recorded as deferred revenue and are included in Noncurrent Other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company does not have any material contract assets as of December 31, 2023. Research and Development The costs of research and development are charged as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. Leases The Company leases certain real estate, fleet assets, warehouses and equipment. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less (""short-term leases"") are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet; the Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating lease right-of-use (""ROU"") assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. Because most of the Company's leases do not provide an implicit rate of [/862]

[503]: 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies [/503]
[504]: Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. [/504]
[505]: Segment Disclosure We have determined that there is one reportable segment, with activities related to providing car wash services. The car wash locations are geographically diversified and have similar economic characteristics and nature of services. Our Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) is the Chief Executive Officer and therefore only one measure of profit or loss and assets are used in deciding how to allocate resources and measure performance. [/505]
[506]: 42 [/506]
[507]: Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Estimates also affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods reported. Some of the significant estimates that we have made pertain to the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities; estimates utilized to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations and the related goodwill and intangibles; and certain assumptions used related to the evaluation of goodwill, intangibles, and property and equipment asset impairment. Actual results could differ from those estimates. [/507]
[413]: Financing Activities . Our net cash provided by financing activities primarily consists of proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee plans and payments on finance lease obligations. [/413]
[414]: For the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was $8.6 million and was primarily comprised of proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee plans, partially offset by payments of finance lease obligations and other financing activities. [/414]
[415]: For the year ended December 31, 2022, net cash provided by financing activities was $6.3 million and was primarily comprised of proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee plans, partially offset by payments of long-term debt and finance lease obligations. [/415]
[416]: Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates [/416]
[417]: Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.

[531]: The results for all acquisitions are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of each respective acquisition. Business acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method by assigning the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill.  We determine the fair value of such assets and liabilities, often in consultation with third-party valuation advisors.  Acquired intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives.  Adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the purchase price allocation period. [/531]

[398]: Cost of Sales [/398]
[399]: Cost of sales increased in 2023, primarily driven by the impact of higher net sales.  Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales for 2023 was 56.7%, compared with 57.3% for 2022. Refer to the “Business Segment Operating Results” discussion later in this section for additional discussion of changes in cost of sales. [/399]
[400]: Selling, General and Administrative Expenses [/400]
[401]: Selling, general and administrative expenses, including research and development expense, were higher in 2023, primarily driven by higher net sales in 2023.  Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was 21.4% for 2023, compared with 21.2% for 2022.  Corporate expense in 2023 was $65.6 million, compared with $65.9 million in 2022. [/401]
[402]: Acquired Intangible Asset Amortization [/402]
[403]: Acquired intangible asset amortization for 2023 was $196.7 million, compared with $201.7 million for 2022, primarily related to decreased expense within the Digital Imaging and Instrumentation segments. [/403]
[404]: Operating Income [/404]
[405]: Operating income increased in 2023 due to higher operating income in each segment except the Digital Imaging segment. [/405]
[473]: Table element - Text before table: Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was $836.1 million and $486.8 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively.  The higher cash provided by operating activities in 2023, compared with 2022 primarily resulted from a payment of $296.4 million to the Swedish Tax Authority in the first quarter of 2022, related to a disputed pre-acquisition 2018 tax reassessment issued to a FLIR subsidiary in Sweden as well as lower inventory purchases and stronger accounts receivable collections in 2023 compared with 2022. These changes were partially offset by higher accounts payable and income tax payments in 2023 as compared with 2022.

[921]: Non-GAAP Coal revenues. Met segment operations non-GAAP coal revenues decreased $521.6 million, or 14.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to a $46.05, or 20.4%, reduction in average non-GAAP coal sales realization as prices moderated from the higher levels experienced during the prior year period, partially offset by a 6.9% increase in Met coal sales volumes. The elevated coal sales pricing environment in the prior year period was driven by increased coal demand, resulting from improved economic activity, coupled with limited supply response. [/921]
[1147]: The Company has disaggregated revenue between met coal and thermal coal and export and domestic revenues which depicts the pricing and contract differences between the two. Export revenue generally is derived by spot or short term contracts with pricing determined at the time of shipment or based on a market index; whereas domestic revenue is characterized by contracts that typically have a term of one year or longer and with fixed pricing terms. The following tables disaggregate the Company’s coal revenues by product category and by market to depict how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of the Company’s coal revenues and cash flows are affected by economic factors: [/1147]
[1149]: Performance Obligations [/1149]
[1150]: The Company considers each individual transfer of coal on a per shipment basis to the customer a performance obligation. The pricing terms of the Company’s contracts with customers include fixed pricing, variable pricing, or a combination of both fixed and variable pricing. All the Company’s revenue derived from contracts with customers is recognized at a point in time. The following table includes estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied as of December 31, 2023. [/1150]

[1269]: Level 3 Fair Value Measurements Contingent Revenue Obligation - The fair value of the Contingent Revenue Obligation was estimated using a Black-Scholes pricing model. The inputs included in the Black-Scholes pricing model are the Company’s forecasted future revenue, the stated royalty rate, the remaining periods in the obligation, annual risk-free interest rate based on the U.S. Constant Maturity Treasury Curve and annualized volatility. The annualized volatility was calculated by observing volatilities for comparable companies with adjustments for the Company's size and leverage. As the royalty period ended on December 31, 2022, the fair value of the remaining obligation as of that date represents the actual final calculated payment made during the first quarter of 2023. Refer to Note 14 for additional information. [/1269]
[1270]: (17) Income Taxes [/1270]
[1152]: (1) Amounts only include estimated coal revenues associated with contracts with customers with fixed pricing with original expected duration of more than one year. The Company has elected not to disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) as of the end of the reporting period for performance obligations with either of the following conditions: 1) the remaining performance obligation is part of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less; or 2) the remaining performance obligation has variable consideration that is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation.

[1263]: (1) The loss recognized in earnings resulted primarily from an increase in forecasted future revenue as of December 31, 2022. [/1263]
[1264]: The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities in the tables above: [/1264]
[1265]: Level 2 Fair Value Measurements [/1265]
[1266]: Trading Securities - Typically includes certificates of deposit, corporate fixed income, and U.S. government securities. The fair values are obtained from a third-party pricing service provider. The fair values provided by the pricing service provider are based on observable market inputs including credit spreads and broker-dealer quotes, among other inputs. The Company classifies the prices obtained from the pricing services within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because the underlying inputs are directly observable from active markets. However, the pricing models used entail a certain amount of subjectivity and therefore differing judgments in how the underlying inputs are modeled could result in different estimates of fair value. [/1266]
[903]: Management uses non-GAAP financial measures to supplement GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business than GAAP results alone. The definition of these non-GAAP measures may be changed periodically by management to adjust for significant items important to an understanding of operating trends and to adjust for items that may not reflect the trend of future results by excluding transactions that are not indicative of our core operating performance. Furthermore, analogous measures are used by industry analysts to evaluate the Company’s operating performance. Because not all companies use identical calculations, the presentations of these measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and can differ significantly from company to company depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate, capital investments and other factors.

[900]: Income tax expense of $106.2 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2022 on income before income taxes of $1,554.8 million. The effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the decrease in the valuation allowance and favorable permanent differences for the percentage depletion allowance and the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. Refer to Note 17 for additional information. [/900]
[901]: Non-GAAP Financial Measures [/901]
[902]: The discussion below contains “non-GAAP financial measures.” These are financial measures that either exclude or include amounts that are not excluded or included in the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP” or “GAAP”). Specifically, we make use of the non-GAAP financial measures “Adjusted EBITDA,” “non-GAAP coal revenues,” “non-GAAP cost of coal sales,” and “non-GAAP coal margin.” We use Adjusted EBITDA to measure the operating performance of our segments and allocate resources to the segments. Adjusted EBITDA does not purport to be an alternative to net income (loss) as a measure of operating performance or any other measure of operating results, financial performance, or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, this measure is not calculated identically by all companies and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because management believes it is a useful indicator of the financial performance of our coal operations. We use non-GAAP coal revenues to present coal revenues generated, excluding freight and handling fulfillment revenues. Non-GAAP coal sales realization per ton for our operations is calculated as non-GAAP coal revenues divided by tons sold. We use non-GAAP cost of coal sales to adjust cost of coal sales to remove freight and handling costs, depreciation, depletion and amortization - production (excluding the depreciation, depletion and amortization related to selling, general and administrative functions), accretion on asset retirement obligations, amortization of acquired intangibles, net, and idled and closed mine costs. Non-GAAP cost of coal sales per ton for our operations is calculated as non-GAAP cost of coal sales divided by tons sold. Non-GAAP coal margin per ton for our coal operations is calculated as non-GAAP coal sales realization per ton for our coal operations less non-GAAP cost of coal sales per ton for our coal operations. The presentation of these measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. [/902]

[934]: Met segment operations. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $688.8 million, or 38.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by decreased coal margin and lower non-GAAP coal sales realization per ton in the current period. [/934]
[935]: All Other category. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $18.7 million, or 51.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by a decrease in tons sold and decreased coal margin, partially offset by higher non-GAAP coal sales realization per ton in the current period.

[940]: Our primary sources of liquidity are derived from existing unrestricted cash balances, proceeds from future coal sales, and amounts available under our revolving credit agreement. Our primary capital resource requirements stem from the cost of our coal production and purchases, selling and administrative expenses, taxes, capital expenditures, debt service obligations, reclamation obligations, and collateral requirements.

[830]: The following discussion and analysis provides a narrative of our results of operations and financial condition for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes and the risk factors included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For discussion on results of operations and financial condition pertaining to 2021 and year-over-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021, refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. [/830]
[1121]: The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). [/1121]
[1122]: (2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies [/1122]
[1123]: Use of Estimates The preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include inventories; mineral reserves and resources; long-lived asset impairments; reclamation obligations; post-employment and other employee benefit obligations; useful lives, depletion and amortization; reserves for workers’ compensation and black lung claims; deferred income taxes; income taxes payable; income taxes refundable and receivable; reserves for contingencies and litigation; and fair value of financial instruments.  Estimates are based on facts and circumstances believed to be reasonable at the time; however, actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash held with reputable depository institutions and highly liquid, short-term investments, such as highly-rated money market funds, with original maturities of three months or less. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. [/1123]
[1054]: Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. [/1054]

[759]: The Company has four reportable geographic segments: U.S., LAAP, EMEA, and Canada, which are reflective of the Company's internal organization, management and oversight structure. Each geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing, and distribution of outdoor, active and lifestyle products, including apparel, footwear, accessories, and equipment. Intersegment net sales and intersegment profits, which are recorded at a negotiated mark-up and eliminated in consolidation, are not material. Unallocated corporate expenses consist of expenses incurred by centrally-managed departmental functions, including consumer digital technology, certain supply chain functions, finance, human resources and legal, as well as executive compensation, unallocated benefit program expense, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges and other miscellaneous costs. [/759]
[381]: Results of Operations — Segment [/381]
[382]: Segment operating income includes net sales, cost of sales, SG&A expenses, and net licensing income for each of our four reportable geographic segments. Operating income as a percentage of net sales in the U.S. is typically higher than the other segments primarily due to scale efficiencies associated with the larger base of net sales in the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, incremental licensing income. [/382]
[383]: We anticipate this trend to continue until other segments achieve scale efficiencies from higher levels of net sales volume relative to the fixed cost structure necessary to operate the business. [/383]

[603]: result, the Company adjusts estimates of revenue at the earlier of when the most likely amount of consideration the Company expects to receive changes or when the amount of consideration becomes fixed. If actual or expected future returns and claims are significantly different than the sales reserves established, the Company records an adjustment to Net sales in the period in which it made such determination. Licensing income, which is presented separately as Net licensing income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and represents less than 1 % of total revenue, is recognized over time based on the greater of contractual minimum royalty guarantees and actual, or estimated, sales of licensed products by the Company's licensees. The Company expenses sales commissions when incurred, which is generally at the time of sale, because the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded within SG&A expenses . Revenue recognized from contracts with customers is recorded net of sales taxes, value added taxes, or similar taxes that are collected on behalf of local taxing authorities. Shipping and Handling Costs Fees for shipping and handling activities which are billed to customers and consumers are recorded as Net Sales . The Company has elected to account for shipping and handling activities that occur after a customer has obtained control of a good as fulfillment costs rather than an additional performance obligation. Freight costs associated with the shipment of goods to customers and consumers, including freight costs associated with the transfer of inventory within the Company's distribution network and to our retail stores, are recorded as Cost of sales . Shipping and handling costs also include costs associated with the handling of inventory and warehousing costs associated with the operation of our owned distribution centers and third-party logistics providers are recorded as SG&A expenses , and were $ 183.2 million , $ 155.8 million and $ 114.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. COST OF SALES Cost of sales consists of all direct costs to source and purchase inventory, including product costs, freight, duties and other importation costs, as well as specific provisions for excess, close-out or slow-moving inventory. In addition, certain products carry life-time or limited warranty provisions for defects in quality and workmanship. Cost of sales includes a warranty reserve established for these provisions at the time of sale to cover estimated costs based on the Company's history of warranty repairs and replacements. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES SG&A expenses consists of personnel-related costs, advertising, depreciation and amortization, occupancy, warehousing, and other selling and general operating expenses related to the Company's business functions. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION Stock-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award's fair value. For stock options and service-based restricted stock units, stock-based compensation cost is recognized over the expected requisite service period using the straight-line attribution method. For performance-based restricted stock units, stock-based compensation cost is recognized based on the Company's assessment of the probability of achieving the related performance targets. The Company estimates forfeitures for stock-based awards granted, but which are not expected to vest.

[/584]
[585]: PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Columbia Sportswear Company, its wholly owned subsidiaries and entities in which it maintained a controlling financial interest (the ""Company""). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. [/585]
[586]: ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""GAAP"") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. The Company's significant estimates relate to sales reserves, allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, excess, close-out and slow-moving inventory, impairment of long-lived assets, impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, and income taxes. [/586]
[619]: TRADE RECEIVABLES [/619]
[620]: The Company had one customer that accounted for approximately 19.8 % and 13.8 % of Accounts receivable, net as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of Net sales for any of the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 or 2021. [/620]

For the year ended December 31, 2023 , there was no impairment recorded for intangible assets with indefinite lives. For the year ended December 31, 2022, an im pairment charge of $ 18.7 million was recorded for the impairment of prAna's trademar k and trade name (collectively, ""trademark""), which is an indefinite-lived intangible asset recorded in the U.S. segment. The impairment of the prAna trademark was determined as part of the annual impairment test. The decline in estimated fair value from the fourth quarter 2021 impairment test [/631]

[637]: GOODWILL [/637]
[638]: The following table sets forth the changes in Goodwill . [/638]
[640]: Substantially all of the Company's goodwill is recorded in the U.S. segment. For the years ended December 31 2023 and 2022, the impairment of goodwill attributable to the prAna reporting unit was determined as part of the annual impairment test. The Company estimated the fair value of the prAna reporting unit using a combination of discounted cash flow analysis and market-based valuation methods. Key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow models included the cash flow projections and the discount rate. Cash flow projections are developed in part from our annual planning process. The discount rate reflected the estimated weighted-average cost of capital of the reporting unit from a market-participant perspective. The market-based valuation methods to estimate fair value of the reporting units utilized market multiples for guideline public companies . For the year ended December 31, 2 023 an impairment charge of $ 25.0 million was recorded. The decline in estimated fair value from the fourth quarter 2022 impairment test reflected an increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used in the discounted cash flow model and lower operating income levels. For the y ear ended December 31, 2022, an impairment charge of $ 16.9 million was recorded. The decline in estimated fair value from the fourth quarter 2021 impairment test reflected lower assumed revenue and operating income levels, while the weighted-average cost of capital used in the discounted cash flow model remained relatively unchanged. For the year ended December 31, 2021 , there was no impairment recorded for goodwill. [/640]

[463]: Our impairment tests and related fair value estimates are based on a number of factors, including assumptions and estimates for projected net sales, income, cash flows, discount rates, market-based multiples, and other operating performance measures. Changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results. These assumptions and estimates may change in the future due to changes in economic conditions, changes in our ability to meet sales and profitability objectives or changes in our business operations or strategic direction.

[1275]: As of December 31, 2023, the Company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to product development, raising capital and building infrastructure and has not generated any revenues from any sales of its therapeutic products. To date, the Company’s revenues have been derived from collaboration agreements and government grants. [/1275]
[1276]: Use of Estimates The Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements requires it to make estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The most significant estimates in the Company’s consolidated financial statements relate to its stock appreciation milestone obligations, contracts containing leases, and accrued expenses. Although these estimates are based on the Company’s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately materially differ from these estimates and assumptions.

[1116]: Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates [/1116]
[1117]: Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to the fair value of the stock price appreciation milestones for the Amended MSKCC License, contracts containing leases, accrued expenses, stock-based compensation, and the estimated total costs expected to be incurred under our collaboration agreements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, financial models, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. [/1117]
[1105]: General and Administrative Expenses [/1105]
[1106]: General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation, for our employees in executive, operational, finance and human resource functions; professional fees for accounting, legal and tax services; costs for obtaining, prosecuting, maintaining, and enforcing our intellectual property; and other costs and fees, including director and officer insurance premiums, to support our operations as a public company. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will remain significant in the future as we maintain our focus on innovation, and research and development activities, maintain compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements, protect and enforce our intellectual property, and continue to operate as a public company. [/1106]
[1107]: Other Income (Expense) [/1107]
[1108]: Other income (expense) consists of changes in the fair value of stock price appreciation milestones associated with the Amended and Restated Exclusive License Agreement dated May 15, 2018 (Amended MSKCC License) with MSKCC, interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents and interest income from investments (including the amortization of discounts and premiums). [/1108]
[1141]: The fair value of our restricted stock units, including performance-based restricted stock units, is based on the closing price of our common stock as reported on The NASDAQ Global Market on the date of grant. [/1141]

[1148]: Revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized revenue of $63.5 million under our collaboration agreements with Janssen and Ono. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized revenue of $96.3 million under our collaboration agreements with Janssen and Ono. The decrease in revenue was attributable primarily to the termination of our collaboration with Janssen in April 2023. The following table summarizes the revenue recognized with respect to each collaboration partner for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022: [/1148]

[1055]: We were incorporated in Delaware in 2007 and are headquartered in San Diego, California. Since our inception in 2007, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our cell programming approach and the research and development of our product candidates, the creation, licensing and protection of related intellectual property, and the provision of general and administrative support for these activities. To date, we have funded our operations primarily through the public and private sale of common stock, the private placement of preferred stock and convertible notes, commercial bank debt and revenues from collaboration activities and grants. [/1055]
[1056]: We have never been profitable and have incurred net losses in each year since inception. Substantially all of our net losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to continue to incur operating losses for at least the foreseeable future. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. We expect our expenses will remain significant in connection with our ongoing and planned activities as we: [/1056]
[1227]: Basis for Opinion [/1227]
[1228]: These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. [/1228]
[1229]: We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. [/1229]
[1294]: Revenue Recognition The Company analyzes its collaboration arrangements to assess whether they are within the scope of ASC 808, to determine whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards that are dependent on the commercial success of such activities. If the Company concludes that some or all aspects of the arrangement represent a transaction with a customer, the Company accounts for those aspects of the arrangement within the scope of ASC 606. For arrangements attributable to ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of control of a product or a service to a customer and reflects the amount of the consideration the Company is entitled to receive in exchange for such product or service. In doing so, the Company follows a five-step approach: (i) identify the contract with a customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the customer obtains control of the product or service.

[1287]: Investments Investments are accounted for as available-for-sale securities and are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. Upon initial recognition of the investment and at each reporting period, the Company evaluates whether any unrealized losses on investments are attributable to a credit loss or other factors. Any unrealized losses attributable to credit loss are recorded through an allowance for credit losses, limited to the amount by which the fair value is below amortized cost, with the offsetting amount recorded in other income or expense in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. Unrealized losses not attributable to an expected credit loss and unrealized gains on investments are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Realized gains and losses, if any, on investments classified as available-for-sale securities are included in other income or expense. The amortized cost of investments classified as available-for-sale debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization and accretion are included in interest income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale are included in interest income. [/1287]

[1432]: 115 Table of Contents [/1432]
[1433]: Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the Code), substantial changes in the Company’ s ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards that could be used annually in the future to offset taxable income. The tax benefits related to future utilization of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, credit carryforwards, and other deferred tax assets may be limited or lost if cumulative changes in ownership exceeds 50 % within any three-year period. The Company completed a study to assess whether an ownership change, as defined by Section 382 of the Code, had occurred from the Company’s formation through December 31, 2015. Based upon this study, the Company determined that several ownership changes had occurred. Accordingly, the Company reduced its deferred tax assets related to the federal NOL carryforwards and the federal R&D credit carryforwards that are anticipated to expire unused as a result of these ownership changes. These tax attributes were excluded from deferred tax assets with a corresponding reduction of the valuation allowance with no net effect on income tax expense or the effective tax rate. The Company updated the study December 31, 2023 and concluded there were no ownership changes during 2023. Future ownership changes may further limit the Company’s ability to utilize its remaining tax attributes. [/1433]

[1277]: Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. To date, the aggregate operations of these subsidiaries have not been significant and all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. [/1277]
[1278]: Segment Reporting Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision-maker in making decisions regarding resource allocation and assessing performance. The Company views its operations and manages its business in one operating and reportable segment. [/1278]
[1279]: Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company’s financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, stock price appreciation milestones, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities. The carrying amounts of accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities are considered to be representative of their respective fair values because of the relatively short-term nature of those instruments. The accounting guidance defines fair value, establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, the accounting guidance establishes a three- tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2: Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and Level 3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.

[536]: Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates [/536]
[537]: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. [/537]
[538]: Some of these estimates and assumptions include judgments on revenue recognition, estimates for common area maintenance and real estate tax accruals, provisions for uncollectible accounts, impairment of long-lived assets, the allocation of purchase price between tangible and intangible assets, capitalization of costs and fair value measurements. The Company’s significant accounting policies and estimates are described in more detail in Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Company’s Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. However, the following policies are deemed to be critical: [/538]
[830]: The Management Companies provide property management, leasing, corporate, development, redevelopment and acquisition services to affiliated and non-affiliated shopping centers. In consideration for these services, the Management Companies receive monthly management fees generally ranging from 1.5 % to 4 % of the gross monthly rental revenue of the properties managed. [/830]
[831]: Property: Maintenance and repair expenses are charged to operations as incurred. Costs for major replacements and betterments, which includes HVAC equipment, roofs, parking lots, etc., are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Gains and losses are recognized upon disposal or retirement of the related assets and are reflected in earnings. [/831]

[776]: Revenues [/776]
[777]: Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased by $48.5 million when compared with the year ended December 31, 2022. Our acquisition of the Youda Games’ card game portfolio and InnPlay Labs contributed to revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023, without which the year-over-year decrease in our revenues would have been greater. Revenue growth from our casual games were unable to offset the revenue declines coming from our social casino-themed [/777]

[1057]: Acquisition of JustPlay.LOL Ltd [/1057]
[1040]: 98 [/1040]
[1041]: Company has determined that displaying the advertisements within the mobile games is identified as a single performance obligation. The transaction price in advertising arrangements is established by our advertising service providers and is generally the product of the number of advertising units delivered (e.g. impressions, offers completed, etc.) and the contractually agreed upon price per unit. Revenue from advertisements and offers are recognized at a point-in-time when the advertisements are displayed in the game or the offer has been completed by the user as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided from these services. The Company has determined that it is generally acting as an agent in its advertising arrangements as the advertising service providers maintain the relationship with the customers, control the pricing of the advertising such that the Company does not know the total price paid by the customer to the service providers, and control the advertising product through the time the advertisements are displayed in our games. Therefore, the Company recognizes revenue related to these arrangements on a net basis. Advertising expenses Costs for marketing and advertising of the Company’s games are primarily expensed as incurred and are included in the sales and marketing expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Such costs primarily consist of player acquisition costs. Advertising expense was $ 451.8 million, $ 464.6 million and $ 457.8 million in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense The Company has a stock-based compensation program which provides for equity awards including time-based stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”). Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for options and RSUs and on an accelerated basis for PSUs. The Company records forfeitures as a reduction of stock-based compensation expense as those forfeitures occur. The Company used the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value and compensation cost associated with stock options. As it does not have a long history of market prices for its common stock because the stock was not publicly traded prior to January 2021, the Company used observable data for a group of peer companies that grant options with substantially similar terms to assist in developing its volatility assumptions. If factors change and the Company employs different assumptions, stock-based compensation cost on future awards may differ significantly from what the Company has recorded in the past. Higher volatility and longer expected terms result in an increase to stock-based compensation determined at the date of grant. Future stock-based compensation cost and unrecognized stock-based compensation will increase to the extent that the Company grants additional equity awards to employees or assumes unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions. If there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested equity awards, the Company may be required to accelerate any remaining unearned stock-based compensation cost or incur incremental cost. The Company uses the associated per-share value at the time of grant to determine the compensation cost to be recognized associated with RSUs and PSUs granted. The Company reviews the estimates of performance against the defined criteria to assess the expected payout of each outstanding PSU grant quarterly, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate there may be a change, and adjusts the stock compensation expense accordingly. For RSUs, shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory income tax withholding to be paid by the Company on behalf of its employees. As a result, fewer shares are generally issued than the number of RSUs outstanding, and the income tax withholding is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital. The Company’s stock-based compensation expense is recorded in the financial statement line item relevant to each of the award recipients. See Note 13, Equity Transactions and Stock Incentive Plan, for additional disclosure. [/1041]

[801]: Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by $22.0 million when compared with the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily related to increased amortization expense, increased media buy expenses, increased stock-based compensation costs, and increased headcount and higher associated payroll costs.

[803]: General and administrative expenses [/803]
[804]: General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by $9.0 million when compared with the year ended December 31, 2021. General and administrative expenses includes stock-based compensation expenses of $69.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared with $64.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Included in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021, with no comparable amount for the year ended December 31, 2022, are bonus expenses of approximately $35.4 million paid as a result of the successful initial public offering of the Company’s stock in January 2021. Adjusting for these items, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $39.3 million, primarily due to increased compensation costs associated with the long-term incentive plan and costs associated with exploring strategic alternatives, which were partially offset by reduced expense attributable to adjusting contingent consideration to fair value.

[784]: Sales and marketing expenses [/784]
[785]: Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased by $18.0 million when compared with the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses was primarily related to decreased offline media expenses, depreciation and amortization expense, and decreased headcount and lower associated payroll costs. [/785]
[786]: General and administrative expenses [/786]
[787]: General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased by $28.9 million when compared with the year ended December 31, 2022. Included in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022, with no comparable amounts for the year ended December 31, 2023, are $7.5 million of costs related to the acquisition of Reworks and to certain office closures, and reversals of $14.1 million of contingent consideration expense related to the JustPlay and Reworks acquisitions. General and administrative expenses for the year December 31, 2023 include a $1.0 million tax assessment paid under protest. Further, the Company incurred $6.6 million and $24.7 million in costs related to strategic alternatives, for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Adjusting for these items, the remaining decrease of general and administrative expenses of approximately $19.8 million is primarily due to decreased compensation costs and, to a lesser degree, a decrease in costs associated with relocation and support provided to employees due to the war in Ukraine. [/787]
[1079]: Based upon the final valuation procedures, the estimated fair value of contingent consideration at the acquisition date was decreased from the Company’s initial estimates by $ 12 million, with a corresponding decrease to goodwill. The formal valuation also allowed the Company to conclude on and record the value of the intangible assets acquired other than goodwill of $ 14.8 million, with a corresponding decrease to goodwill. Other than these two measurement period adjustments, there were no other material changes to the initial purchase price allocation resulting from the finalization of the valuation process within the measurement period. [/1079]
[1080]: The goodwill, which is non-deductible for tax purposes, is generally attributable to synergies between the Company's and InnPlay's respective studio operations and games. [/1080]
[1081]: 106 [/1081]
[1082]: The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed (in millions): [/1082]
[1084]: Transaction costs incurred by the Company in connection with the InnPlay acquisition were approximately $ 1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, and were recorded within general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Pro forma results of operations for this acquisition subsequent to the September 28, 2023 acquisition date have not been presented because the incremental results from InnPlay, both individually and when aggregated with Youda pro forma results of operations, are not material to the consolidated statements of comprehensive income presented herein.

[601]: Gross profit, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues, was 37.0% and 30.4% for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net service revenues was due to a decrease of 6.6% in direct payroll expense as a percentage of net service revenues. [/601]
[602]: The home health segment’s general and administrative expenses consist of administrative employee wages, taxes and benefit costs, rent, information technology and office expenses. General and administrative expenses, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues, was 24.7% and 23.9% for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to acquisitions that resulted in a $3.1 million increase in administrative employee wages, taxes and benefit costs and a $0.3 million increase in rent expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023.

The financial results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully evaluated. [/604]
[1017]: Segment operating income consists of revenue generated by a segment, less the direct costs of service revenues and general and administrative expenses that are incurred directly by the segment. Unallocated general and administrative costs are those costs for functions performed in a centralized manner and therefore not attributable to a particular segment. These costs include accounting, finance, human resources, legal, information technology, corporate office support and facility costs and overall corporate management. [/1017]

[637]: * Management deems Adjusted EBITDA to be a key performance indicator. Management uses key performance indicators to monitor our performance, both in our existing operations and acquisitions. Many of these metrics serve as the basis of reported revenues and assessment of these, provide direct correlation to the results of operations from period to period and facilitate comparison with the results of our peers. Historical trends established in these metrics can be used to evaluate current operating results, identify trends affecting our business, determine the allocation of resources and assess the quality and potential variability of our cash flows and earnings. We believe they are useful to investors in evaluating and understanding our business but should not be used solely in assessing the Company’s performance. These key performance indicators should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented herein to fully evaluate and understand the business as a whole. These measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled performance indicators used by other companies. [/637]

[470]: ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FIN ANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS [/470]
[471]: You should read the following discussion together with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of the factors we describe under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other risks as well as other factors that are not currently known to us, that we currently consider immaterial or that are not specific to us, such as general economic conditions. The discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, included in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) can be found in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. [/471]
[691]: For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we performed the quantitative analysis to evaluate whether an impairment occurred. Since quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available, we rely on widely accepted valuation techniques to determine fair value, including discounted cash flow and market multiple approaches, which capture both the future income potential of the reporting unit and the market behaviors and actions of market participants in the industry that includes the reporting unit. These types of models require us to make assumptions and estimates regarding future cash flows, industry-specific economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies. The discounted cash flow model uses a projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital. The market multiple model estimates fair value based on market multiples of earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization. Under the discounted cash flow model, the projection uses management’s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period for each reporting unit using significant assumptions such as revenue growth rates, operating margins and the weighted-average cost of capital.

[917]: Table element - Text before table: JourneyCare
On February 1, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of the hospice and palliative operations of JourneyCare. The purchase price was approximately $ 86.6 million, including the amount of acquired excess cash held by JourneyCare at the closing of the acquisition (approximately $ 0.4 million) plus the finalization of net working capital payable to seller of $ 1.6 million. The JourneyCare acquisition was funded with a combination of a $ 35.0 million draw on the Company’s revolving credit facility and available cash. With the JourneyCare acquisition, the Company expanded its hospice services to patients in the state of Illinois. The related acquisition and integration costs were $ 0.5 million and $ 4.3 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2022. These costs are included in general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income and were expensed as incurred.
Based upon management’s valuations, which are preliminary and subject to completion of working capital adjustments, the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired are as follows:; table: (row 0)

[922]: first half of the year relative to the second half of the year. In addition, we expect our corporate, general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future to support our growth and because of additional costs of being a public company. Due to the timing of many of these investments, including our primary sales and marketing season, we typically incur a greater level of investment in the second half of the year relative to the first half of the year.

[978]: Revenues. Earned premium revenues were $1,800.9 million and $1,431.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, an increase of $369.4 million or 25.8%. The increase was driven by a combination of growth in our Health Plan membership and higher revenue per member per month in 2023 as compared to 2022. Health plan membership increased 21.2% between December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The increase in revenue per member per month is primarily attributable to an increase in the CMS benchmark rates. Additionally, ACO REACH revenue, also included in earned premiums, increased $73.0 million, or 143.3% for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. Other revenues increased $20.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of 770%. The increase is mainly attributable to an increase in the interest rate of our interest earning cash balances. [/978]

[1122]: Additionally, on September 15, 2022, we entered into an underwriting agreement with respect to an underwritten offering by certain selling stockholders of 9,000,000 shares of our common stock. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares. We incurred $ 579 in transaction costs in connection with this offering. [/1122]
[1123]: 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies [/1123]
[1124]: Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, our subsidiaries, and three immaterial variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Noncontrolling interest is presented within the equity section of the consolidated balance sheets. We have no components of other comprehensive income (loss), and accordingly, comprehensive income (loss) is the same as the net income (loss) for all periods presented. [/1124]
[963]: Capitation-related expenses are recorded on an accrual basis during the coverage period. Expenses related to fee-for-service contracts are recorded in the period in which the related services are dispensed. [/963]
[964]: Pharmacy costs represent payments for members’ prescription drug benefits, net of rebates from drug manufacturers. Receivables for such pharmacy rebates are included in accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheet. [/964]
[965]: Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of (i) personnel expenses including salaries, bonuses, equity-based compensation expense and benefits for non-clinical employees; (ii) all corporate technology, occupancy costs and allocated overhead costs; (iii) professional and outside services, including external vendors and professional services; (iv) costs associated with administering our contracts with CMS, including claims adjudication, member and concierge services, provider engagement, and other health plan functions; and (v) central and community-based advertising costs to generate greater awareness, engagement and retention among our current and prospective members, as well as the infrastructure required to support all of our marketing efforts and ongoing commission payments. These expenses also include certain growth expenditures, including business development and various new market expansion activities. Our investments in our sales, marketing and other growth activities are an important component of our selling, general and administrative expenses in a typical year given our desire to continue to grow on an accelerated trajectory. We anticipate continuing to invest heavily in our growth efforts in the near future, which we believe will be an important driver of long-term value creation. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we incur costs associated with being a public company and growing our business. [/965]

[1063]: Alignment Healthcare, Inc.: [/1063]
[1064]: Opinion on the Financial Statements [/1064]
[1065]: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alignment Healthcare, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes listed in the accompanying Index (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. [/1065]
[925]: Table element - Text before table: first half of the year relative to the second half of the year. In addition, we expect our corporate, general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future to support our growth and because of additional costs of being a public company. Due to the timing of many of these investments, including our primary sales and marketing season, we typically incur a greater level of investment in the second half of the year relative to the first half of the year.
Key Business Metrics
In addition to our financial information in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), we review a number of operating and financial metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions.; table: (row 0)

[1460]: 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies [/1460]
[1461]: Basis of Presentation The Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The consolidated financial statements include the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates such estimates and assumptions for continued reasonableness. In particular, management makes estimates with respect to revenue recognition, accruals for research and development activities, stock-based compensation expense, and income taxes. Appropriate adjustments, if any, to the estimates used are made prospectively based upon such periodic evaluation. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Segments To date, the Company has viewed its financial information on an aggregate basis for the purposes of evaluating financial performance and allocating the Company’s resources. Accordingly, the Company has determined that it operates in one segment. [/1461]
[1203]: Other revenue [/1203]
[1204]: Other revenue is a result of license revenues received in connection with the Huadong  Agreement. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. [/1204]
[1205]: Cost of Sales [/1205]
[1206]: Cost of sales increased by $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was related primarily to additional ZORYVE cream product costs incurred. Prior to the date on which the initial regulatory approval was received, costs of raw materials were recorded as research and development expense. Therefore, cost of sales will reflect a lower average per unit cost until the related inventory is sold, which is expected to occur over the next two years. [/1206]

[1209]: Research and Development Expenses [/1209]
[1211]: ______________ [/1211]
[1212]: *Not applicable [/1212]
[1213]: Research and development expenses decreased by $71.9 million, or 39%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due the completion of Phase 3 studies of ZORYVE cream in atopic dermatitis and ZORYVE foam in seborrheic dermatitis and scalp and body psoriasis, as well as the IPR&D expense as a result of the acquisition of ARQ-234 from Ducentis in the third quarter of 2022. Additionally, manufacturing costs recorded as research and development expenses decreased as we began capitalizing such costs to inventory upon FDA approval of ZORYVE cream in July 2022. [/1213]

[1178]: Research and Development Expenses [/1178]
[1179]: Since our inception, we have focused significant resources on our research and development activities, including conducting nonclinical studies and clinical trials, manufacturing development efforts, and activities related to regulatory filings for our product candidates. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. These costs include direct program expenses, which are payments made to third parties that specifically relate to our research and development, such as payments to clinical research organizations, clinical investigators, manufacturing of clinical material, nonclinical testing, and consultants. In addition, employee costs, including salaries, payroll taxes, benefits, stock-based compensation, and travel for employees contributing to research and development activities are classified as research and development costs. We allocate direct external costs on a program specific basis (topical roflumilast program, topical JAK inhibitor program, and early-stage programs). Our internal costs are primarily related to personnel or professional services and apply across programs, and thus are not allocable on a program specific basis. [/1179]

[1489]: services such as: data reporting, inventory management, chargeback administration, and service level commitment. The Company estimates the amount of distribution services fees to be paid to the Customers and adjusts the transaction price with the amount of such estimate at the time of sale to the Customer. Prompt Pay Discounts : The Company provides some of its Customers with a percentage discount on their invoice if the Customers pay within the agreed upon timeframe. The Company estimates the probability of Customers paying promptly based on the percentage of discount outlined in the purchase agreement between the two parties, and deducts the full amount of these discounts from its gross product revenue and accounts receivable at the time such revenue is recognized. Product Returns : The Company provides Customers a return credit in the amount of the purchase price paid by Customers for all products returned in accordance with the Company’s returned goods policy. In the initial sales period, the Company estimates its provision for sales returns based on industry data and adjusts the transaction price for such estimate at the time of sale to the Customer. Once sufficient history has been collected for product returns, the Company will utilize that history to inform its returns estimate. Once the product is returned, it is destroyed. If actual returns vary from estimates, the Company may need to adjust accruals, which would affect revenue in the period of adjustment.  The Company does not record a right-of-return asset. Chargeback : A chargeback is the difference between the manufacturer's invoice price to the wholesaler and the wholesaler’s customer's contract price. The wholesaler tracks these sales and ""charges back"" the manufacturer for the difference between the negotiated prices paid between the wholesaler's customers and wholesaler's acquisition cost. The Company estimates the percentage of goods sold that are eligible for chargeback and adjusts the transaction price for such discount at the time of sale to the Customer. Co-payment Assistance :  Patients who meet certain eligibility requirements may receive co-payment assistance. The Company records contra-revenue for co-payment assistance based on actual program participation and estimates of program redemption using data provided by third-party administrators. Rebates and Discounts: The Company accrues rebates for contractually agreed-upon discounts with commercial insurance companies and mandated discounts under government programs such as the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program in the United States. The Company's estimates for expected utilization of commercial insurance rebates are based on data received from its customers. The Company's estimates for rebates under government programs are based on statutory discount rates and expected utilization as well as historical data it has accumulated since product launch. Rebates are generally invoiced and paid in arrears so that the accrual balance consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter’s activity, plus an accrual balance for known prior quarters’ unpaid rebates. If actual rebates vary from estimates, the Company may need to adjust accruals, which would affect revenue in the period of adjustment. Other Revenues Other revenues is related to the Huadong License and Collaboration Agreement. See Note 6. The Company evaluated the agreement with Huadong and determined that it is within the scope of ASC 606.  The Company applied the five-step model as required by ASC 606 to determine revenue recognition. The nonrefundable upfront payment that the Company received in September 2023 in connection with the transfer of the license and related know-how to Huadong was determined to be a distinct performance obligation, and therefore was recognized in Other revenues. The Company evaluated whether the development and regulatory milestones are considered probable of being reached and determined that their achievement is highly dependent on factors outside of the Company’s control. Therefore, these payments are subject to significant revenue reversal and are therefore not included in the transaction price. At the end of each reporting period, the Company will re-evaluate the probability of achievement of each milestone and, if necessary, adjust its estimate of the overall transaction price and accordingly recognize the related revenue once the probability of significant reversal of revenue is low. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, and would be reported in Other revenues in the period of adjustment. The sales milestones and royalties will be recognized in Other revenues when the related sales occur. Cost of Sales [/1489]

[1486]: Accrued and Prepaid Nonclinical and Clinical Costs The Company records accrued liabilities for estimated costs and prepaid costs for research and development activities conducted by third-party service providers, which include the conduct of nonclinical studies, clinical trials, and contract manufacturing activities. These costs are a significant component of the Company’s research and development expenses. The Company accrues for these costs based on factors such as estimates of the work completed and in accordance with agreements established with its third-party service providers under the service agreements. The Company makes significant judgments and estimates in determining the accrued liabilities and prepaid costs balance in each reporting period. As actual costs become known, the Company adjusts its accrued liabilities. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company has not experienced any material differences between accrued costs and actual costs incurred. Revenues Pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), the Company recognizes revenue when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services. The Company records the amount of revenue that reflects the consideration that it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company applies the following five-step model in order to determine this amount: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that it will collect the consideration to which it is entitled in exchange for the goods or services that it transfers to the customer. Once a contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606 at contract inception, the Company reviews the contract to determine which performance obligations it must deliver and which of these performance obligations are distinct. The Company recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to each performance obligation when that performance obligation is satisfied or as it is satisfied. Product Revenue, Net The Company sells its product to its Customers in the United States and Canada. The Company’s Customers subsequently resell the products to pharmacies, health care providers, and patients. In accordance with ASC 606, the Company recognizes net product revenue from sales when the Customers obtain control of the Company’s products, which typically occurs upon delivery to the Customer. The Company’s payment terms are generally between 30 - 65 days. Revenue from product sales are recorded at the net sales price, or “transaction price,” which includes estimates of variable consideration that result from (a) invoice discounts for prompt payment and distribution service fees, (b) government and private payer rebates, chargebacks, discounts and fees, (c) product returns and (d) costs of co-pay assistance programs for patients, as well as other incentives. Reserves are established for the estimates of variable consideration based on the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. The reserves are classified as reductions to trade receivables, net if payable to a Customer or accrued liabilities if payable to a third-party. Where appropriate, the Company utilizes the expected value method to determine the appropriate amount for estimates of variable consideration based on factors such as the Company’s historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price may be constrained and is included in net product revenue only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from the Company’s"

[934]: NOTE 15 – SEGMENT REPORTING [/934]
[935]: As described in Note 1, our operations are assessed based on two reportable segments. The operations of our segments are managed separately, and each segment has unique technology, services and customer classes. We account for intersegment sales at prices that we generally establish by reference to similar transactions with unaffiliated customers. Reportable segments are measured based on operating income exclusive of general corporate expenses and gains (losses) on sales of corporate assets. [/935]

[426]: Critical Accounting Estimates [/426]
[427]: Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""GAAP""). Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management's application of accounting policies. We believe the following are our most critical accounting policies that we apply in the preparation of our financial statements. These policies require our most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain, and the impact of these policies have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. [/427]
[428]: See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Report for further discussion of significant accounting policies. [/428]
[723]: Disaggregated Revenues [/723]
[724]: We allocate geographic revenues based on the location of the customers' operations. Revenues by geographic area and customer type were as follows: [/724]

[727]: Table of Contents [/727]
[728]: Revenues by timing of transfer of goods or services were as follows: [/728]
[730]: Revenues by contract type were as follows: [/730]
[732]: Performance Obligations [/732]
[733]: As we progress on our contracts and the underlying performance obligations for which we recognize revenue over time, we refine our estimates of variable consideration and total estimated costs at completion, which impact the overall profitability on our contracts and performance obligations. Changes in these estimates result in the recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments that impact our revenues and/or costs of contracts. The aggregate impact of changes in estimates increased our revenue and operating income as follows: [/733]
[735]: (1) During the year ended December 31, 2023, our Government Operations segment results were favorably impacted by contract adjustments related to a nuclear operations contract which resulted in an increase in operating income of $ 22.5 million. Our Government Operations segment also recognized favorable adjustments totaling $ 27.9 million as a result of the successful negotiation of change orders related to cost growth that was driven by out-of-scope changes associated with the manufacture of non-nuclear components.

[637]: DECEMBER 31, 2023 [/637]
[638]: NOTE 1 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES [/638]
[639]: We have presented the consolidated financial statements of BWX Technologies, Inc. (""BWXT"") in U.S. dollars in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""GAAP""). We use the equity method to account for investments in entities that we do not control, but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence. We generally refer to these entities as ""joint ventures."" We have eliminated all intercompany transactions and accounts. We classify assets and liabilities related to long-term contracts as current using the duration of the related contract or program as our operating cycle, which is generally longer than one year. We have reclassified certain amounts previously reported to conform to the presentation at December 31, 2023 and for the year ended December 31, 2023. We present the notes to our consolidated financial statements on the basis of continuing operations, unless otherwise stated. Unless the context otherwise indicates, ""we,"" ""us"" and ""our"" mean BWXT and its consolidated subsidiaries. Reportable Segments We operate in two reportable segments: Government Operations and Commercial Operations. Our reportable segments are further described as follows: • Our Government Operations segment manufactures naval nuclear reactors, including the related nuclear fuel, for the U.S. Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program for use in submarines and aircraft carriers. Through this segment, we also fabricate fuel-bearing precision components that range in weight from a few grams to hundreds of tons, manufacture electro-mechanical equipment, perform design, manufacturing, inspection, assembly and testing activities and downblend Cold War-era government stockpiles of high-enriched uranium. In addition, we supply proprietary and sole-source valves, manifolds and fittings to global naval and commercial shipping customers. In-house capabilities also include wet chemistry uranium processing, advanced heat treatment to optimize component material properties and a controlled, clean-room environment with the capacity to assemble railcar-size components. This segment also provides various other services, primarily through joint ventures, to the U.S. Government including nuclear materials management and operation, environmental management and administrative and operating services for various U.S. Government-owned facilities. These services are provided to the U.S. Department of Energy (""DOE""), including the National Nuclear Security Administration, the Office of Nuclear Energy, the Office of Science and the Office of Environmental Management, the Department of Defense and NASA. In addition, this segment also develops technology for advanced nuclear reactors for a variety of power and propulsion applications in the space and terrestrial domains and offers complete advanced nuclear fuel and reactor design and engineering, licensing and manufacturing services for these programs. • Our Commercial Operations segment fabricates commercial nuclear steam generators, nuclear fuel, fuel handling systems, pressure vessels, reactor components, heat exchangers, tooling delivery systems and other auxiliary equipment, including containers for the storage of spent nuclear fuel and other high-level waste and supplies nuclear-grade materials and precisely machined components for nuclear utility customers. We have supplied the nuclear industry with more than 1,300 large, heavy components worldwide, and we are the only commercial heavy nuclear component manufacturer in North America. This segment also provides specialized engineering services that include structural component design, 3-D thermal-hydraulic engineering analysis, weld and robotic process development, electrical and controls engineering and metallurgy and materials engineering. In addition, this segment offers in-plant inspection, maintenance and modification services for nuclear steam generators, heat exchangers, reactors, fuel handling systems and balance of plant equipment, as well as specialized non-destructive examination and tooling/repair solutions. This segment also manufactures medical radioisotopes, radiopharmaceuticals and medical devices, and partners with life science and pharmaceutical companies developing new drugs. See Note 15 and Note 3 for financial information about our segments. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards There were no accounting standards adopted during the year ended December 31, 2023 that had a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.

[750]: The following tables summarize combined balance sheet and income statement information for investments accounted for under the equity method: [/750]
[753]: Reimbursable costs recorded in revenues by the unconsolidated joint ventures in our Government Operations segment totaled $ 5,126.6 million, $ 4,453.7 million and $ 4,102.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. [/753]
[754]: Income taxes for the investees are the responsibility of the respective owners. Accordingly, no provision for income taxes has been recorded by the investees. [/754]
[755]: Reconciliations of net income per combined income statement information of our investees to equity in income of investees per our consolidated statements of income are as follows: [/755]
[757]: Our transactions with unconsolidated affiliates were as follows: [/757]

[760]: NOTE 5 – INCOME TAXES [/760]
[761]: We are subject to federal income tax in the U.S., Canada and the U.K., as well as income tax within multiple U.S. state jurisdictions. We provide for income taxes based on the enacted tax laws and rates in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our operations. These jurisdictions may have regimes of taxation that vary with respect to nominal rates and with respect to the basis on which these rates are applied. This variation, along with the changes in our mix of income within these jurisdictions, can contribute to shifts in our effective tax rate from period to period. [/761]
[574]: Critical Audit Matter [/574]
[575]: The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. [/575]
[576]: Revenue Recognition – Estimating Costs at Completion – Refer to Note 1 and Note 3 to the Financial Statements. [/576]
[577]: Critical Audit Matter Description [/577]
[578]: The Company generally recognizes contract revenues and related costs over time for individual performance obligations based on a cost-to-cost method in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Topic Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The Company recognizes estimated contract revenue and resulting income based on the measurement of the extent of progress toward completion as a percentage of the total project. The Company reviews contract price and cost estimates periodically as the work progresses and reflect adjustments proportionate to the percentage-of-completion in income in the period when those estimates are revised. The accounting for these contracts involves judgment, particularly as it relates to the process of estimating total costs to complete the performance obligation. [/578]
[579]: Given the significance of revenue and the level of judgment involved in estimating total costs to complete the performance obligations used to recognize revenue for long-term contracts, auditing such estimates involved especially subjective judgment. [/579]
[580]: 43 [/580]
[581]: Table of Contents [/581]
[582]: How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit [/582]
[583]: Our audit procedures related to revenues recognized over time, including management’s estimates of total contract costs to complete its performance obligations, included the following, among others: [/583]
[584]: • We tested the effectiveness of controls over revenue recognized over time, including those over cost estimates at completion for performance obligations. [/584]
[585]: • Unless otherwise tested separately below, we tested recorded revenue using analytical procedures. [/585]
[586]: • We analyzed cumulative adjustments recorded during the year and separately tested those with characteristics of audit interest due to their size to determine that the adjustments were the result of changes in facts and circumstances and recorded in the appropriate period. [/586]
[450]: Under the market valuation approach, we employ the guideline publicly traded company method, which indicates the fair value of the equity of each reporting unit by comparing it to publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. After identifying and selecting guideline companies, we analyze their business and financial profiles for relative similarity. Factors such as size, growth, risk and profitability are analyzed and compared to each of our reporting units. Assumptions include the selection of our peer companies and use of market multiples, which could increase or decrease based on the profitability of our competitors and performance of their stock, which is often dependent on the performance of the stock market and general economy as a whole. [/450]
[451]: 33 [/451]
[452]: Table of Contents [/452]
[453]: Adverse changes in the assumptions utilized in our impairment test could cause a reduction or elimination of excess fair value over carrying value, resulting in potential recognition of impairment. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to goodwill in the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value. [/453]

[1052]: No country other than the United States accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The geographical revenue information is determined by the ship-to address of the products and the billing address of the cust omers of the services. [/1052]

[1055]: Contract Asset and Liability Balances — Contract assets consist of unbilled accounts receivable and are recorded when revenue is recognized in advance of scheduled billings. The timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing to customers and this timing difference results in contract liabilities (deferred revenue) on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The accounts receivable and contract balances as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (in thousands): [/1055]
[943]: Revenue Recognition - Subscription, Services, and Product Revenue [/943]
[944]: As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue from subscription, license, services and sale of products. The Company’s total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $157.7 million, of which subscription, services, and product revenue was $157.6 million. The Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. [/944]
[945]: The principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition of subscription, services, and product revenue is a critical audit matter is a high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures related to the Company’s revenue recognition. [/945]
[946]: Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls over the recognition of subscription, services, and product revenue as the amount of consideration expected in exchange for goods or services. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing the completeness, accuracy, and occurrence of revenue recognized for a sample of revenue transactions by obtaining and inspecting source documents, such as contracts, purchase orders, invoices, proof of shipment or delivery, and subsequent payment receipts and (ii) performing subsequent receipts testing for a sample of outstanding customer invoice balances as of December 31, 2023 and, for invoices not yet paid, obtaining and inspecting source documents, such as contracts, purchase orders, invoices, and proof of shipment or delivery.

As of December 31, 2023, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments of approximatel y $423.0 million. Our c ash equivalents primarily consist of cash on hand and amounts on deposit with financial institutions. To date, our principal sources of liquidity have been proceeds received from the issuance of equity, proceeds from the Merger and proceeds from warrant and option exercises for cash. [/830]
[994]: 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES [/994]
[995]: Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Significant estimates include assumptions related to the fair value of common stock before the Merger and other assumptions used to measure stock-based compensation, fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, fair value of identified intangibles, goodwill impairment, valuation of deferred tax assets, the estimate of net realizable value of inventory, allowance for doubtful accounts, the fair value of warrants liability, loss contingencies, and the determination of stand-alone selling price of various performance obligations. As a result, many of the Company’s estimates and assumptions require increased judgment and these estimates may change materially in future periods. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and various other factors, including the current economic environment, which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The Company adjusts such estimates and assumptions when dictated by facts and circumstances. Changes in those estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements in future periods. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates. [/995]
[821]: Table element - Text before table: Non-GAAP Loss from Operations
We calculate non-GAAP loss from operations as GAAP loss from operations excluding stock-based compensation-related charges (including share-based payroll tax expense), restructuring charges, acquisition-related costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and payroll tax related to contingent earn-out share issuance, which we do not consider to be indicative of our overall operating performance. We believe this measure provides our management and investors with consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and is an important indicator of the performance and profitability of our business.

[1083]: Goodwill generated from this business combination is primarily attributable to the assembled workforce and expected post-acquisition synergies from integrating Enview technology with Matterport’s products and services. The goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. [/1083]
[1084]: The following table summarizes the estimated fair values and estimated useful lives of the components of identifiable intangible assets acquired as of the Enview Acquisition Date (in thousands, except years): [/1084]
[1086]: Developed technology relates to existing Enview technology of its AI algorithms to identify natural and man-made features in geospatial data. The economic useful life was determined based on the technology cycle related to the developed technology of existing services, as well as the cash flows anticipated over the forecasted periods. [/1086]
[1087]: 94 [/1087]
[1088]: The fair value of developed technology was estimated using the multi-period excess earnings method, an income approach (Level 3), which converts projected revenues and costs into cash flows. Significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis for the developed technology were the revenue growth rates, EBITDA margins, obsolescence technology factor, and discount rate. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of the Enview Acquisition were not material to the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. [/1088]

[900]: 69 [/900]
[901]: Table of Content [/901]
[902]: Inventory Valuation [/902]
[903]: We record inventories at the lower of cost and net realizable value and record write-downs of inventories that are obsolete or in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. A review of inventory is performed each fiscal quarter that considers factors including the marketability and product lifecycle stage, product development plans, component cost trends, historical sales, and demand forecasts that consider the assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Inventory on hand that is not expected to be sold or utilized is considered excess, and we recognize the write-down in the cost of goods sold at the time of such determination. The write-down is determined by the excess of cost over net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. At the time of loss recognition, new cost basis per unit and the lower-cost basis for that inventory are established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances would not result in an increase in the cost basis. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for our products or an unanticipated change in technological or customer requirements, we may be required to record additional write-downs that could adversely affect gross margins in the period when the write-downs are recorded. We also extend the assessment to non-cancelable purchase orders if the inventories are considered excess and record the liability that is reasonably possible to be incurred in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. [/903]
[780]: Table element - Text before table: Product revenue decreased by $2.2 million, or 6%, to $32.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, from $35.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to the normalized demand for our Pro3 Camera during the year ended December 31, 2023 since our initial launch in the third quarter of 2022, and lower net sales of our Pro2 Camera.

[841]: Net Cash Used in Operating Activities [/841]
[842]: Net cash used in operating activities was $58.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This amount primarily consisted of a net loss of $199.1 million, offset by non-cash charges of $131.9 million, and a change in net operating assets and liabilities of $8.5 million. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of $118.8 million of stock-based compensation expense, $19.4 million of depreciation and amortization expense, and $1.8 million of inventory obsolescence, partially offset by $8.9 million of accretion of discounts, net of amortization premiums. Changes in net operating assets and liabilities primarily consisted of a decrease in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other assets and an increase in deferred revenue, partially offset by an increase in inventories and a decrease in other liabilities and accounts payable.

[857]: 87 [/857]
[858]: 15. Segments [/858]
[859]: The Company has two aggregated reporting segments: subscription business and other business. The subscription business segment consists of products that have been created to meet the needs of their distribution channels and have similar target margin profiles. This segment generates revenue primarily from subscription fees related to the Company's direct-to-consumer products. The other business segment generates revenue primarily by underwriting policies on behalf of third parties. The Company does not undertake marketing efforts for these policies and has a business-to-business relationship with these third-parties. The other business segment also includes other products and insurance software solutions that have a different margin profile from the Company’s subscription business segment. The chief operating decision maker reviews revenue and operating income (loss) to evaluate segment performance. Revenue, veterinary invoice expense, other cost of revenue, and new pet acquisition expenses are generally directly attributed to each segment. Other operating expenses, such as technology and development expense, general and administrative expense, and depreciation and amortization, are generally allocated proportionately based on revenue in each segment. Interest and other expenses and income taxes are not allocated to the segments, nor included in the measure of segment profit or loss. The Company does not analyze discrete segment balance sheet information related to long-term assets. [/859]

[690]: Opinion on the Financial Statements [/690]
[691]: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Trupanion, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. [/691]
[692]: We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 26, 2024 expressed an adverse opinion thereon.

[544]: 43 [/544]
[546]: 44 [/546]
[547]: When determining our PAC, we calculate net acquisition cost for a more comparable metric across periods. Net acquisition cost, a non-GAAP financial measure, is calculated in a reporting period as GAAP new pet acquisition expense, excluding stock-based compensation expense, other business segment expense, and pet acquisition expense for commission-based policies, offset by sign-up fee revenue. We exclude stock-based compensation expense because the amount varies from period to period based on the number of awards issued and market-based valuation inputs. We exclude other business segment pet acquisition expense because it does not relate to subscription enrollments.  We exclude pet acquisition expense for commission-based policies because the revenue of these products is earned from commissions from a third party underwriter, as opposed to the gross underwriting premiums earned by the remainder of our subscription business. We offset sign-up fee revenue because it is a one-time charge to new members collected at the time of enrollment used to partially offset initial setup costs, which are included in new pet acquisition expenses.

[609]: Technology and Development Expenses [/609]
[611]: Year ended December 31, 2023 compared to year ended December 31, 2022. Technology and development expenses decreased by $3.7 million, or 15%, to $21.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $5.0 million in development expense as several initiatives that were pre-revenue in the prior year were launched and have begun generating revenue. Expenses associated with these initiatives are now recorded within the income statement based on the underlying nature of the expense. This decrease was partially offset by a $1.1 million increase in general compensation and other employee-related expenses and a $0.9 million increase in IT system hosting expenses. Technology and development expenses decreased from 3% to 2% of total revenue year over year [/611]
[612]: General and Administrative Expenses [/612]
[614]: Year ended December 31, 2023 compared to year ended December 31, 2022. General and administrative expenses increased by $20.8 million, or 53%, to $60.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in expense was primarily due to a $4.8 million increase in stock-based compensation related to charges after certain executive departures and a $3.8 million increase related to the negotiated settlement of uncollected premiums in connection with the transition of underwriting a third-party business to other insurers. Additionally, there was a $6.4 million increase in general compensation and other employee-related expenses, a $2.2 million increase"

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

 (col 1): Accounting for revenue from collaboration agreements (row end);
 (row 2) 
 (col 0): Description of the Matter (col 1): The Company recorded revenue from collaboration agreements of $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company enters into collaboration agreements under which the Company licenses rights to certain of its product candidates and performs research and development services. Amounts received under these arrangements typically include non-refundable upfront fees, reimbursement of research and development costs, development, regulatory, and commercial milestone payments, and royalties on net sales of licensed products. Auditing the Company’s accounting for revenues from collaboration arrangements was complex and required significant judgments primarily in identifying the performance obligations, including whether options to provide license rights represent material rights, the determination of estimated selling prices and the allocation of the arrangement consideration to the performance obligations. (row end);
 (row 3) 
 (col 0): How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit (col 1): To test the accounting for revenue from collaboration arrangements, our audit procedures included, among others, inspecting the collaboration agreement, assessing the appropriateness of the Company’s technical accounting analyses and testing the application of the applicable accounting guidance. This included testing the completeness and appropriateness of the Company’s identification of performance obligations. We evaluated the determination of the estimated selling prices used to allocate arrangement consideration to the performance obligations, as well as the determination of any significant and incremental discount present in customer options and tested the underlying data used in the analysis. We also assessed the consistency of the judgments and related conclusions to other similar arrangements and evaluated any contrary evidence identified. (row end);

[1830]: Operating segments are defined as components of an entity about which separate discrete information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The CODM is the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. The Company views its operations as and manages its business in one operating segment operating exclusively in the United States. [/1830]
[1831]: Subsequent events [/1831]
[1832]: The Company performs an evaluation of all subsequent events after the balance sheet date through the date of issuance of the consolidated financial statements to ensure appropriate disclosure of events both recognized in the consolidated financial statements and events which occurred subsequently but were not recognized in the consolidated financial statements. [/1832]
[1645]: Critical accounting policies and significant judgments [/1645]
[1646]: This management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. [/1646]

[1647]: While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2, Summary of significant accounting policies, to our consolidated financial statements, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: [/1647]
[1648]: • revenue recognition; and [/1648]
[1649]: • accrued research and development expenses. [/1649]
[1650]: Revenue Recognition [/1650]
[1651]: We enter into collaboration agreements which are within the scope of Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , or ASC 606, under which we license rights to certain of our product candidates and perform research and development services. The terms of these arrangements typically include payment of one or more of the following: non-refundable, upfront fees; reimbursement of research and [/1651]
[1652]: 139 [/1652]
[1653]: development costs; development, regulatory, and commercial milestone payments; and royalties on net sales of licensed products. [/1653]
[1654]: Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized for arrangements determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we perform the following five steps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) we satisfy each performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. The areas of our revenue recognition policy that contain significant judgment include the determination of performance obligations, including customer options, the determination of estimated selling prices and the allocation of transaction price to our identified performance obligations. [/1654]
[1958]: 13. Income taxes [/1958]
[1959]: The Company's losses before income taxes consist solely of losses from domestic operations, which totaled $ 199.8 million , $ 157.3 million and $ 120.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. [/1959]
[1960]: Income tax expense (benefit) is summarized as follows: [/1960]
[1962]: F- 30 [/1962]
[1963]: A reconciliation of the income tax expense computed using the federal statutory income tax rate to the Company’s effective income tax rate is as follows: [/1963]
[1965]: F- 31 [/1965]
[1966]: Deferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes. The significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 are comprised of the following : [/1966]
[1968]: The Company has incurred net operating losses in each year since inception. Management has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of the Company’s net deferred tax assets, which are comprised primarily of net operating loss carryforwards, tax credits, and costs capitalized for tax purposes. Management has considered the Company’s history of cumulative net losses in the United States and estimated future tax losses and has determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will not recognize the benefits of the net deferred tax assets. As a result, the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance at December 31, 2023 and 2022. The valuation allowance increased by $ 62.5 million in 2023, due to the increase in deferred tax assets, primarily due to net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards, and increase in deferred tax assets associated with current year temporary items. [/1968]

[1817]: Revenue Recognition The Company enters into collaboration agreements which are within the scope of ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), under which the Company licenses rights to certain of the Company’s product candidates and performs research and development services. The terms of these arrangements typically include payment of one or more of the following: non-refundable, upfront fees; reimbursement of research and development costs; development, regulatory, and commercial milestone payments; and royalties on net sales of licensed products. Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized for arrangements determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. The promised goods or services in the Company’s arrangements typically consist of license rights to the Company’s intellectual property and research and development services. The Company provides options to additional items in the contracts, which are accounted for as separate contracts when the customer elects to exercise such options, unless the option provides a material right to the customer. The Company evaluates the customer options for material rights, or options to acquire additional goods or services for free or at a discount. If the customer options are determined to represent a material right, the material right is recognized as a separate performance obligation at the outset of the arrangement. Performance obligations are promised goods or services in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and are considered distinct when (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or together with other readily available resources and (ii) the promised good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. In assessing whether promised goods or services are distinct, the Company considers factors such as the stage of development of the underlying intellectual property, the capabilities of the customer to develop the intellectual property on its own or F- 12 whether the required expertise is readily available and whether the goods or services are integral or dependent to other goods or services in the contract. The Company estimates the transaction price based on the amount expected to be received for transferring the promised goods or services in the contract. The consideration may include fixed consideration or variable consideration. At the inception of each arrangement that includes variable consideration, the Company evaluates the number of potential payments and the likelihood that the payments will be received. The Company utilizes either the most likely amount method or expected amount method to estimate the amount expected to be received based on which method best predicts the amount expected to be received. The amount of variable consideration which is included in the transaction price may be constrained and is included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period. The Company’s contracts often include development and regulatory milestone payments which are assessed under the most likely amount method and constrained if it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would occur. Milestone payments that are not within the Company’s control or the licensee’s control, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. At the end of each reporting period, the Company re-evaluates the probability of achievement of such development milestones and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect collaboration revenues in the period of adjustment. To date, the Company has not recognized any consideration related to the achievement of development, regulatory, or commercial milestone revenue resulting from any of the Company’s collaboration arrangements. For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, the Company recognizes revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). To date, the Company has not recognized any consideration related to sales-based royalty revenue resulting from any of the Company’s collaboration arrangements. The Company allocates the transaction price based on the estimated stand-alone selling price of each of the performance obligations. The Company must develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract. The Company utilizes key assumptions to determine the stand-alone selling price for service obligations, which may include other comparable transactions, pricing considered in negotiating the transaction and the estimated costs. Additionally, in determining the standalone selling price for material rights, the Company utilizes comparable transactions, clinical trial success probabilities, and estimates of option exercise likelihood. Variable consideration is allocated specifically to one or more performance obligations in a contract when the terms of the variable consideration relate to the satisfaction of the performance obligation and the resulting amounts allocated are consistent with the amounts the Company would expect to receive for the satisfaction of each performance obligation. The consideration allocated to each performance obligation is recognized as revenue when control is transferred for the related goods or services. For performance obligations which consist of licenses and other promises, the Company utilizes judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress. The Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. Upfront payments and fees are recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt or when due until the Company performs its obligations under these arrangements. Amounts are recorded as accounts receivable when the Company’s right to consideration is unconditional. [/1817]
[1808]: There have been no changes to the valuation methods utilized by the Company during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. The Company evaluates transfers between levels at the end of each reporting period. There were no transfers of financial instruments between levels during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 . [/1808]
[1809]: Property and equipment, net [/1809]
[1810]: Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense is recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of each asset as follows: [/1810]
[1812]: Upon retirement or sale, the cost of assets disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in loss from operations. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. [/1812]
[1813]: Impairment of long-lived assets [/1813]
[1814]: The Company evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. There were no impairment losses recognized during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 . [/1814]

[1031]: 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES [/1031]
[1032]: Use of Estimates —The preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Items that require estimates, judgments or assumptions include, but are not limited to, determining variable consideration and identifying the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses, fair value and estimated useful lives of long- and indefinite-lived assets, litigation loss contingencies, liabilities related to incurred but not reported insurance claims, fair value and achievement of targets for performance-based restricted stock units (“PRSUs”) and income taxes. These estimates, judgments and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements; therefore, actual results could differ from management’s estimates due to macroeconomic uncertainty and other factors. Foreign Currency Translation —The consolidated financial statements of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated at exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates in effect during the year. Translation adjustments are recorded within accumulated other comprehensive loss, a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Cash and Cash Equivalents —The Company considers all highly liquid investments, such as treasury bills, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, and money market instruments with maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of amounts held in interest-bearing money market funds that were readily convertible to cash. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value. [/1032]
[1236]: 18. INFORMATION ABOUT REVENUE AND GEOGRAPHIC AREAS [/1236]
[1237]: The Company considers operating segments to be components of the Company for which separate financial information is available and evaluated regularly by the Company’s chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The chief operating decision maker for the Company is the chief executive officer. The chief executive officer reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis, accompanied by information about revenue by product line and geographic region for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. The Company has determined that it has a single operating and reporting segment. When the Company communicates results externally, it disaggregates net revenue into major product lines and primary geographical markets, which is based on the billing address of the customer. The disaggregation of net revenue by major product lines is based on the type of service provided and also aligns with the timing of revenue recognition for each. To reflect the Company’s strategic focus on creating differentiated experiences for its Services categories and Restaurants, Retail & Other categories, the Company further disaggregates advertising revenue to reflect these two high-level category groupings. The Services categories consist of the following businesses: home, local, auto, professional, pets, events, real estate and financial services. The Restaurants, Retail & Other categories consist of the following businesses: restaurants, shopping, beauty & fitness, health and other. [/1237]
[857]: We consider the estimates discussed below to be critical as we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with these policies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. For further information on these and our other significant accounting estimates, see Note 2, “ Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , ” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. [/857]
[858]: Revenue Recognition —We generate revenue from the sale of advertising products, transactions with consumers and other revenue sources, which correspond to our major product lines. We recognize revenue by applying the following steps: the contract with the customer is identified; the performance obligations in the contract are identified; the transaction price is determined; the transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations in the contract; and revenue is recognized when (or as) we satisfy these performance obligations in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services. We apply the portfolio practical expedient to account for contracts with customers in each category of revenue. We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which the amount of revenue we recognize is equal to the amount we have a right to invoice. [/858]
[967]: Critical Audit Matter [/967]
[968]: The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. [/968]
[969]: Advertising Revenue – Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements [/969]
[970]: Critical Audit Matter Description [/970]
[971]: The Company’s revenue consists of advertising placements, primarily performance-based cost-per-click advertising (CPC), which is comprised of a significant volume of low-dollar transactions, initiated and maintained within internally developed systems. The processing and recording of those transactions are highly automated and are based on contractual terms with customers. The Company relies on information from these internally developed systems and automations to record its CPC revenue. [/971]
[860]: For revenue generated from arrangements that involve third parties, considerable judgment may be required in evaluating whether we are the principal, and report revenue on a gross basis, or the agent, and report revenue on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider whether we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer as well as other indicators, such as whether we are the party primarily responsible for the fulfillment, inventory risk and discretion in establishing price. The assessment of whether we are considered the principal or agent in a transaction could impact our revenue and cost of revenue recognized on our consolidated statements of operations. Changes in judgments with respect to assumptions and estimates could impact the amount of revenue recognized. [/860]
[861]: Website and Internal-Use Software Development Costs —Costs related to website and internal-use software are primarily related to our website and mobile app, including support systems. We capitalize our costs to develop software when: [/861]

Deferred contract costs are included within other non-current assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets (see Note 10, “ Other Non-Current Assets ” ). Deferred Revenue —The Company records deferred revenue when it has received consideration, or has the right to receive consideration, in advance of the transfer of the performance obligations of the contract to the customer. Property, Equipment and Software —Property, equipment and software are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are approximately three to five years . Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or 10 years. Following the disposition of an asset, the associated net cost is no longer recognized as an asset, and any gain or loss on the disposition is reflected in operating expenses. Website and Internal-Use Software Development Costs —Costs related to website and internal-use software are primarily related to the Company’s website and mobile app, including support systems. The Company capitalizes its costs to develop software when: preliminary development efforts are successfully completed; management has authorized and committed project funding; and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used as intended. Costs incurred for enhancements that are expected to result in additional material functionality are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the upgrades. Such costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset, which is generally three years . The Company capitalizes certain implementation costs incurred related to cloud computing arrangements that are service contracts. Such costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the associated hosting arrangement plus any reasonably certain renewal period. Any capitalized amounts related to such arrangements are recorded within prepaid expense and other current assets and within non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Leases —The Company leases its office facilities under operating lease agreements that expire from 2024 to 2031, some of which include options to renew at the Company’s sole discretion. If exercised, such options would extend the lease terms by five years . Additionally, one of the Company’s lease agreements contains the option to terminate the lease, which requires 12 months prior written notice to the landlord. The Company does not have any finance lease agreements. The Company determines if an"

[893]: Income tax expense [/893]
[894]: Income tax expense decreased $0.8 million, or 34.4%, to $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease from the prior year was primarily attributed to a reduction in federal and state income tax expense related to a net operating loss generated by the TRS partially offset by an increase in state margins taxes levied on gross receipts.

[897]: Non-GAAP Financial Measures [/897]
[898]: We consider the following non-GAAP financial measures useful to investors as key supplemental measures of our operating performance: EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, FFO and Adjusted FFO. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, net income or loss, operating profit, cash from operations, or any other operating performance measure as prescribed per GAAP.

[799]: Our total portfolio RevPAR, which includes the results of hotels sold or acquired for the period of ownership by the Company, increased 4.1% to $169.46 for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $162.75 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in our total portfolio RevPAR for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was driven by increases in both occupancy and ADR. [/799]
[800]: Net income decreased 65.5% for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022, which was primarily attributed to: [/800]
[801]: • no gain or loss on the sale of investment properties in 2023 compared to a $27.3 million gain on the sale of investment properties in 2022; [/801]
[802]: • a $7.0 million reduction in operating income; [/802]
[803]: • a $5.5 million reduction in hotel operating income attributed to the three hotels sold in 2022; [/803]
[804]: • a $3.0 million increase in corporate general and administrative expenses; [/804]

[1170]: 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies [/1170]
[1171]: Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, the Operating Partnership, XHR Holding, as well as all wholly-owned subsidiaries and consolidated real estate investments. The Company's subsidiaries generally consist of limited liability companies, limited partnerships and the TRS. The effects of all inter-company transactions have been eliminated. Corporate costs associated with our executive offices, personnel and other administrative costs are reflected as general and administrative expenses. Each property maintains its own books and financial records and each entity's assets are not available to satisfy the liabilities of other affiliated entities. Reclassifications Certain prior year amounts in these consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023. Use of Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP"") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses. These estimates are prepared using management's best judgment, after considering past, current and expected future economic conditions. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Risks and Uncertainties For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company had a geographical concentration of revenues generated from hotels in the Orlando, Florida and Phoenix, Arizona markets that exceeded 10 % of total revenues for the period then ended. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company had a geographical concentration of revenues generated from hotels in the Orlando, Florida, Phoenix, Arizona and San Diego, California markets that exceeded 10 % of total revenues for the period then ended. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company had a geographical concentration of revenues generated from hotels in the Orlando, Florida, Phoenix, Arizona, San Diego, California, and Houston, Texas markets that exceeded 10 % of total revenues for the period then ended.

[682]: Revenue Recognition [/682]
[683]: Upstream Revenues [/683]
[684]: Upstream revenues include the sale of oil, gas and NGL production. Oil, gas and NGL sales are recognized when production is sold to a purchaser at a fixed or determinable price, delivery has occurred, control has transferred and collectability of the revenue is probable. Devon’s performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time. This occurs when control is transferred to the purchaser upon delivery of contract-specified production volumes at a specified point. The transaction price used to recognize revenue is a function of the contract billing terms. Revenue is invoiced, if required, by calendar month based on volumes at contractually based rates with payment typically received within 30 days of the end of the production month. Taxes assessed by governmental authorities on oil, gas and NGL sales are presented separately from such revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings. [/684]
[691]: 55 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) [/691]
[692]: Marketing Revenues [/692]
[693]: Marketing revenues are generated primarily as a result of Devon selling commodities purchased from third parties. Marketing revenues are recognized when performance obligations are satisfied. This occurs at the time contract-specified products are sold to third parties at a contractually fixed or determinable price, delivery occurs at a specified point or performance has occurred, control has transferred and collectability of the revenue is probable. The transaction price used to recognize revenue and invoice customers is based on a contractually stated fee or on a third party published index price plus or minus a known differential. Devon typically receives payment for invoiced amounts within 30 days. Marketing revenues and expenses attributable to oil, gas and NGL purchases are reported on a gross basis when Devon takes control of the products and has risks and rewards of ownership. [/693]
[581]: We exclude financing costs from EBITDAX to assess our operating results without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. Exploration expenses and asset disposition gains and losses are excluded from EBITDAX because they generally are not indicators of operating efficiency for a given reporting period. DD&A and impairments are excluded from EBITDAX because capital expenditures are evaluated at the time capital costs are incurred. We exclude share-based compensation, valuation changes, restructuring and transaction costs, accretion on discounted liabilities and other items from EBITDAX because they are not considered a measure of asset operating performance. [/581]
[582]: We believe EBITDAX and Field-Level Cash Margin provide information useful in assessing our operating and financial performance across periods. EBITDAX and Field-Level Cash Margin as defined by Devon may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should be considered in conjunction with net earnings from operations.

[968]: 20. Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Operations (Unaudited) [/968]
[969]: Supplemental unaudited information regarding Devon’s oil and gas activities is presented in this note. All of Devon’s reserves are located within the U.S. [/969]
[970]: Costs Incurred [/970]
[971]: The following tables reflect the costs incurred in oil and gas property acquisition, exploration and development activities. [/971]
[973]: Acquisition costs for 2022 in the table above pertain primarily to the Eagle Ford and Williston Basin acquisitions which closed in the third quarter of 2022. Acquisition costs for 2021 primarily relate to the Merger. Development costs in the tables above include additions and revisions to Devon’s asset retirement obligations. [/973]
[974]: Results of Operations [/974]
[975]: The following table includes revenues and expenses associated with Devon’s oil and gas producing activities. It does not include any allocation of Devon’s interest costs or general corporate overhead and, therefore, is not necessarily indicative of the contribution to net earnings of Devon’s oil and gas operations. Income tax expense has been calculated using statutory income tax rates, and then giving effect to permanent differences associated with oil and gas producing activities. [/975]
[694]: Midstream Revenues [/694]
[695]: Devon’s reported midstream revenue primarily relates to its interest in CDM. CDM provides gathering, compression and dehydration services to Devon and other producers’ natural gas production. An evaluation is performed to determine whether CDM is a principal or agent in these transactions. Under the terms of these gathering, compression and dehydration contracts, CDM has concluded it is the agent as title to the gas production remains with the CDM affiliate producer or a third-party producer. Revenue is recognized on a net basis since CDM is strictly providing a service. Costs to maintain CDM’s assets are presented as marketing and midstream expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings. Revenue is recognized for sales at the time the gathering, compression and dehydration service has been rendered or performed. [/695]
[696]: Satisfaction of Performance Obligations and Revenue Recognition [/696]
[697]: Because Devon has a right to consideration from its customers in amounts that correspond directly to the value that the customer receives from the performance completed on each contract, Devon recognizes revenue for sales at the time the crude oil, natural gas or NGLs are delivered at a fixed or determinable price.

[459]: Production Expenses [/459]
[461]: LOE expenses and LOE per BOE increased primarily due to acquisitions in the Eagle Ford and Williston Basin that both closed in the third quarter of 2022, along with inflation and higher volumes resulting from increased activity in the Delaware Basin and Anadarko Basin. This is partially offset by decreased production taxes due to lower commodity prices. [/461]

A reconciliation to the comparable GAAP measures is found in “Non-GAAP Measures” in this Item 7.

[679]: Segment Information Devon’s oil and gas exploration and production activities are solely focused in the U.S. For financial reporting purposes, Devon aggregates its U.S. operating segments into one reporting segment due to the similar nature of these operations. [/679]
[680]: Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts could differ from these estimates, and changes in these estimates are recorded when known. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the following: • proved reserves and related present value of future net revenues; • evaluation of suspended well costs; • the carrying and fair values of oil and gas properties, other property and equipment and product and equipment inventories; • derivative financial instruments; • the fair value of reporting units and related assessment of goodwill for impairment; • income taxes; • asset retirement obligations; • obligations related to employee pension and postretirement benefits; • legal and environmental risks and exposures; • the fair value of contingent earnout payments; and • general credit risk associated with receivables and other assets.

[714]: Table of Contents Use of Estimates and Judgments in the Preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. Significant estimates and judgments are inherent in the analysis and measurement of items including, but not limited to: revenue recognition criteria including the determination of principal versus agent revenue considerations, income taxes, the valuation and recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets, the assessment of potential loss from contingencies, assumptions in valuing acquired assets and liabilities assumed in business combinations, the allowance for doubtful accounts, and assumptions used in determining the fair value of stock-based compensation. Management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be affected by changes in those estimates. These estimates are based on the information available as of the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment Reporting The Company’s operating segments are determined based on the units that constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which operating results are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”). The CODM is the highest level of management responsible for assessing the Company’s overall performance and making operational decisions. The Company operates in one single operating and reportable segment. Fair Value Measurements The Company evaluates the fair value of certain assets and liabilities using the fair value hierarchy. Fair value is an exit price representing the amount that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, the Company applies the three-tier GAAP value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: Level 1—observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2—inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly; Level 3—unobservable inputs of which there is little or no market data, which require the Company to develop its own assumptions. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measure. The carrying amounts of accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. Foreign Currency A majority of the Company’s revenues are generated in U.S. dollars. In addition, most of the Company’s costs are denominated and determined in U.S. dollars. Thus, the reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is generally the local currency. The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries whose functional currency is a foreign currency are translated at the period-end exchange rates. Income statement items are translated at the average monthly rates for the year. The resulting translation adjustment is recorded as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, net of income taxes and is included in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity. 76 [/714]

Commitments and Contingencies Contingencies Litigation From time to time, the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records liabilities for contingencies including legal costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount can be reasonably estimated. Legal costs are expensed as incurred. Although the outcome of the various legal proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not believe that any of these proceedings or other claims will have a material effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. [/1003]

[632]: Revenue generated from the Company’s Measurement arrangements (f/k/a Advertiser – direct) was $198 million. The Company’s Measurement revenue consists of fees earned on a high volume of individually low monetary-value transactions, sourced from multiple systems, databases, and other tools. The initiation, processing, and recording of Measurement revenue is highly automated and is based on contractual terms with advertisers. [/632]

[634]: In addition, the Company enters into customer arrangements with non-standard terms and conditions including pricing variability through tiered pricing and/or include both Measurement and Activation (f/k/a Advertiser – programmatic) services. These non-standard terms require the Company to apply incremental judgements to determine the distinct performance obligations and the timing of revenue recognition. [/634]
[635]: ​ [/635]
[636]: We identified Measurement revenue as a critical audit matter because the Company’s process to record revenue is highly dependent on the effective design and operation of multiple systems, processes, data sources, and controls. This required an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve professionals with expertise in information technology (“IT”) to identify, test, and evaluate the revenue data flows, systems, and automated controls.

[347]: Segments Results of individual operating segments are presented based on our management accounting practices and management structure. There is no comprehensive, authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; therefore, the financial results of individual segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other company. The management accounting process uses assumptions and allocations to measure performance of the segments. Methodologies are refined from time to time as management accounting practices are enhanced and businesses change. The costs incurred by support areas not directly aligned with the operating segment are allocated primarily based on an estimated utilization of support area services or are included in “Other and Unallocated” in the table above. [/347]
[348]: Table of Contents [/348]
[349]: Management evaluates results of operations of the segments before certain corporate level costs and the effects of certain gains or losses not considered to be related to the core business operations. Management believes that this is a more meaningful representation of the operating performance of its core businesses, the profitability of operating segments, and the extent of cash flow generated from these core operations. Such amounts are presented under the caption “Other and Unallocated.” In the evaluation of operating segment results, management does not use any measures of total assets. This presentation is aligned with the management and operating structure of our company. It is also on this basis that the Company’s performance is evaluated internally and by the Company’s Board of Directors. [/349]

[372]: Table element - Text before table: Income taxes For the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded a $7.0 million income tax provision on a pretax loss of $71.1 million from continuing operations. The comparable amounts for 2022 were a $10.3 million income tax benefit on a pre-tax loss of $204.4 million. The income tax expense in 2023 includes a valuation allowance recorded for the operating losses in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions for which no income tax benefit was recorded, partially offset by a deferred tax benefit associated with a notional interest deduction carryforward at a foreign subsidiary.  The income tax benefit in 2022 includes deferred tax benefits associated with the asset impairment charges and related bad debt and inventory reserves, partially offset by a valuation allowance recorded for the operating losses in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions for which no income tax benefit was recorded .
Foreign Currency We own and operate facilities in Canada, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Spain and the Philippines. The functional currency of our Canadian operations is the U.S. dollar. However, in Germany, France and Spain it is the euro, in the UK, it is the British pound sterling, and in the Philippines the functional currency is the peso. On an annual basis, our euro denominated net sales exceeds euro expenses by an estimated €170 million. For 2023 compared to 2022, the average currency exchange rate of the euro strengthened relative to the U.S. dollar by approximately 2.6% , and the British pound sterling to the dollar strengthened by approximately 0.5%. With respect to the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, and Philippine peso, we have differing amounts of inflows and outflows of these currencies, although to a lesser degree than the euro. As a result, we are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates and such changes could be significant. The translation of the results from international operations into U.S. dollars is subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
The table below summarizes the translation impact on reported results that changes in currency exchange rates had on our non-U.S. based operations from the conversion of these operation’s results for the period indicated.; table: (row 0)

                    This is the available data to answer the question (in the following, if tables have empty cells, they are omitted, if a cell spans several columns, values might be repeated for each cell):
[201]: This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes discussions of operating revenue, net of fuel surcharge revenue; Truckload, Dedicated and Intermodal revenue, net of fuel surcharge revenue; operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, each net of fuel surcharge revenue; and net fuel expense (fuel and fuel taxes net of fuel surcharge revenue and surcharges passed through to independent contractors, outside drayage carriers and railroads). We provide these additional disclosures because management believes these measures provide a more consistent basis for comparing results of operations from period to period. These financial measures in this report have not been determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Pursuant to Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K, we have included the amounts necessary to reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures of operating revenue, operating expenses divided by operating revenue, and fuel and fuel taxes. [/201]
[365]: Revenue recognition: We account for our revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The current revenue standard requires us to recognize revenue and related expenses within each of our four reporting segments over time as our customers simultaneously receive and consume benefits as we perform the freight services. 40 We account for revenue of our Intermodal and Brokerage segments and revenue on freight transported by independent contractors within our Truckload and Dedicated segments on a gross basis because we are the principal service provider controlling the promised service before it is transferred to each customer. We are primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide each specified service to each customer. We bear the primary risk of loss in the event of cargo claims by our customers. We also have complete control and discretion in establishing the price for each specified service. Accordingly, all such revenue billed to customers is classified as operating revenue and all corresponding payments to carriers for transportation services we arrange in connection with brokerage and intermodal activities and to independent contractor providers of revenue equipment are classified as purchased transportation expense within our consolidated statements of operations. See Note 14 for more information. Our largest customer, Walmart, accounted for 19 % of our revenue excluding fuel surcharges in 2023 and 19 % of our trade receivables as of December 31, 2023, 21 % of our revenue in 2022 and 22 % of our trade receivables as of December 31, 2022, and 23 % of our revenue in 2021. During each of 2023, 2022 and 2021, approximately 99 % of our revenue was generated within the United States. [/365]

[463]: The following table sets forth for the years indicated our operating revenue and operating income by segment. We do not prepare separate balance sheets by segment and, as a result, assets are not separately identifiable by segment. [/463]
[465]: Truckload segment depreciation expense was $ 61.6 million, $ 56.4 million and $ 52.1 million, Dedicated segment depreciation expense was $ 46.2 million, $ 45.6 million and $ 43.0 million, Intermodal segment depreciation expense was $ 7.1 million, $ 7.5 million and $ 6.3 million, and Brokerage segment depreciation expense was $ 1.9 million, $ 1.5 million and $ 1.2 million, in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. [/465]
[466]: 52 [/466]
[468]: None. [/468]
[470]: As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2023. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We intend to periodically evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures as required by the Exchange Act Rules. [/470]
[226]: 23 [/226]
[227]: Gain on disposition of revenue equipment was $13.6 million in 2023, up slightly from $13.4 million in 2022 primarily due to an increase in the number of units sold, offset by a decrease in the average gain for our tractor and trailer sales. Future gains or losses on dispositions of revenue equipment will be impacted by the market for used revenue equipment, which is beyond our control. [/227]
[228]: Our operating income declined 37.1% to $90.1 million in 2023 from $143.3 million in 2022 as a result of the foregoing factors. Our operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, or “operating ratio,” was 92.0% in 2023 and 88.7% in 2022. The operating ratio for our Truckload segment was 94.7% in 2023 and 88.1% in 2022, for our Dedicated segment was 88.2% in each of 2023 and 2022, for our Intermodal segment was 100.2% in 2023 and 91.8% in 2022, and for our Brokerage segment was 89.7% in 2023 and 88.9% in 2022. Operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, with both amounts net of fuel surcharges, was 90.7% in 2023 and 86.4% in 2022. [/228]

[280]: Table element - Text before table: We have historically been able to pass through a significant portion of long-term increases in diesel fuel prices and related taxes to customers in the form of fuel surcharges. Fuel surcharge programs are widely accepted among our customers, though they can vary somewhat from customer-to-customer. These fuel surcharges, which adjust weekly with the cost of fuel, enable us to recover a substantial portion of the higher cost of fuel as prices increase. These fuel surcharge provisions are not effective in mitigating the fuel price increases related to non-revenue miles or fuel used while the tractor is idling. In addition, we have worked diligently to control fuel usage and costs by improving our volume purchasing arrangements and optimizing our drivers’ fuel purchases with national fuel centers, focusing on shorter lengths of haul, installing and tightly managing the use of auxiliary power units in our tractors to minimize engine idling and improving fuel usage in our trailers’ refrigeration units.
While we do not currently have any outstanding hedging instruments to mitigate this market risk, we may enter into derivatives or other financial instruments to hedge a portion of our fuel costs in the future.

[208]: The following table sets forth for the years indicated our operating revenue, operating income and operating ratio by segment, along with the change for each component: [/208]
[210]: Our operating revenue decreased $132.4 million, or 10.5%, to $1.131 billion in 2023 from $1.264 billion in 2022. Our operating revenue, net of fuel surcharges, decreased $81.4 million, or 7.7%, to $972.0 million in 2023 from $1.053 billion in 2022. This decrease in 2023 was due to a $38.9 million decrease in Brokerage revenue, a $24.6 million decrease in Intermodal revenue, net of fuel surcharges, a $15.9 million decrease in Truckload revenue, net of fuel surcharges, and a $2.0 million decrease in Dedicated revenue, net of fuel surcharges. Fuel surcharge revenue decreased to $159.4 million in 2023 from $210.4 million in 2022. [/210]

Intermodal segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, increased 14.8% from 2021 primarily due to an increase in revenue per load. The operating ratio in 2022 was negatively impacted by higher company driver compensation, chassis rental and amounts payable to railroads as a percentage of our revenue, partially offset by increased rates with our customers.
Brokerage segment revenue increased $59.3 million, or 40.8%, to $204.6 million in 2022 from $145.3 million in 2021 primarily due to an increase in the number of loads. The improvement in the operating ratio in 2022 was primarily due to increased rates with our customers.

[218]: Table element - Text before table: Intermodal segment revenue decreased $37.7 million, or 29.0%, to $92.1 million in 2023 from $129.8 million in 2022. Intermodal segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, decreased 24.5% from 2022 primarily due to decreases in both our number of loads and our revenue per load. The operating ratio in 2023 increased to 100.2% from 91.8% in 2022. Impacting the 2023 operating ratio was a decrease in our revenue per load along with higher net fuel, company driver compensation, depreciation, maintenance, purchased transportation and chassis rental costs as a percentage of revenue.
Brokerage segment revenue decreased $38.9 million, or 19.0%, to $165.6 million in 2023 from $204.6 million in 2022 primarily due to decreases in both our revenue per load and our number of loads. The operating ratio in 2023 of 89.7% was up from 88.9% in 2022. This increase was due to higher costs across most areas of the segment, partially offset by a decrease in the amounts payable to carriers for transportation services which we arranged as a percentage of our Brokerage revenue.

[714]: Revenue Recognition [/714]
[715]: The Company’s revenue was $881.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. As described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, management recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the customer. The transfer of control generally occurs upon shipment when title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The vast majority of the Company’s revenue is generated from the sale of distinct products. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for such products, which is generally at contractually stated prices. [/715]
[716]: The principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition is a critical audit matter is a high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures related to the Company’s revenue recognition. [/716]
[717]: Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing the completeness, accuracy and existence of revenue recognized for a sample of revenue transactions by obtaining and inspecting source documents, including purchase orders, invoices, and proof of shipment and (ii) confirming a sample of outstanding customer invoice balances as of December 31, 2023 and, for confirmations not returned, obtaining and inspecting source documents, including invoices, proof of shipment, and subsequent cash receipts, where applicable.

[1072]: 18. Segment Information [/1072]
[1073]: Reportable Segments [/1073]
[1074]: The Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) is the Chief Executive Officer. The CODM utilizes financial information to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. The Company evaluates the performance of, and allocates resources to, its segments based on revenue, gross profit and operating profit. The Company’s reportable segments have been identified based on commonality and adjacency of technologies, applications and customers amongst the Company’s individual product lines. The Company determined that disclosing revenue by specific product was impracticable due to the highly customized and extensive portfolio of technologies offered to customers. [/1074]
[1075]: Based upon the information provided to the CODM, the Company has determined it operates in three reportable segments: Precision Medicine and Manufacturing, Medical Solutions, and Robotics and Automation. The reportable segments and their principal activities are summarized below: [/1075]
[779]: Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. Advertising costs were not material for 2023, 2022 and 2021. [/779]
[780]: Restructuring, Acquisition and Related Costs The Company accounts for its restructuring activities in accordance with the provisions of ASC 420, “Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations.” The Company makes assumptions related to the amounts of employee severance benefits and related costs, useful lives and residual value of long-lived assets, and discount rates. Estimates and assumptions are based on the best information available at the time the obligation is recognized. These estimates are reviewed and revised as facts and circumstances dictate. Acquisition related costs incurred to effect a business combination, including finders’ fees, legal, valuation and other professional or consulting fees, are expensed as incurred. Acquisition related costs also include expenses recognized under earn-out agreements in connection with acquisitions. [/780]
[513]: Overview of Financial Results [/513]
[514]: Total revenue for 2023 was $881.7 million, an increase of $20.8 million, or 2.4%, versus 2022. This increase was primarily due to increased demand in the medical markets and revenue from a prior year acquisition. The effect of our prior year acquisition resulted in an increase in revenue of $8.1 million, or 0.9%. In addition, foreign exchange rates favorably impacted our revenue by $1.3 million, or 0.2%, in 2023. [/514]
[515]: Operating income for 2023 was $110.5 million, an increase of $7.4 million, or 7.2%, versus 2022. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit of $21.4 million primarily attributable to higher revenue and a decrease in amortization expense of $5.9 million, partially offset by an increase in restructuring, acquisition and related charges of $8.4 million, research and development and engineering (“R&D”) expenses of $5.9 million, and selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses of $5.6 million. [/515]
[516]: Basic earnings per common share (“basic EPS”) of $2.03 in 2023 decreased $0.05 from the basic EPS of $2.08 in 2022. Diluted earnings per common share (“diluted EPS”) of $2.02 in 2023 decreased $0.04 from the diluted EPS of $2.06 in 2022. The decreases in basic EPS and diluted EPS were primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense, partially offset by an increase in operating income and a decrease in income tax provision. [/516]
[301]: 20 [/301]
[302]: regular operations. Managing a larger and more geographically dispersed operation and product portfolio could also pose challenges for our management team. [/302]
[303]: Further, our ability to maintain and increase the profitability of acquired businesses will depend on our ability to manage and control operating expenses and to generate and sustain increased levels of revenue. Our expectations to achieve more consistent and predictable levels of revenue and to increase profitability as a result of any acquisition may not be realized. Such revenues and profitability may even decline as we integrate newly acquired operations into our existing businesses. We may fail to identify inherent weaknesses in acquired businesses or misinterpret market and technology trends and growth potentials during our acquisition due diligence process. If revenues of acquired businesses decline or grow more slowly than we anticipate, or if their operating expenses are higher than we expect, we may not be able to sustain or increase their profitability, in which case we may not be able to realize the expected return on our investments, our financial condition will suffer, and our stock price could decline. In addition, through our acquisitions, we may assume liabilities, losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or insured or for which our indemnity or insurance is inadequate. Any such liabilities may have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. [/303]
[82]: Table element - Text before table: Segments
During the first quarter of 2023, we changed the names of our reportable segments from “Photonics” to “Precision Medicine and Manufacturing”, from “Vision” to “Medical Solutions”, and from “Precision Motion” to “Robotics and Automation”, respectively. The segment name changes did not result in any change to the compositions of our segments and therefore did not result in any change to historical results.
We have determined that we have three reportable segments. Our reportable segments have been identified based on commonality and adjacency of technologies, applications, and customers amongst our individual product lines. We evaluate the performance of, and allocate resources to, our segments based on revenue, gross profit and operating profit. The following table shows the external revenues, gross profit margin and operating profit for each of the segments for the year ended December 31, 2023 (dollars in millions):; table: (row 0)

[637]: We believe that the following critical accounting policies and estimates most significantly affect the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult and subjective judgments. [/637]
[638]: Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. We recognize revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to customers. This generally occurs upon shipment when the title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The vast majority of our revenue is generated from the sale of distinct products. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for such products, which is generally at contractually stated prices. Sales taxes and value added taxes collected concurrently with revenue generating activities are excluded from revenue. [/638]
[639]: Substantially all of our revenue is recognized at a point in time, upon shipment, rather than over time. At the request of our customers, we may perform professional services, generally for the maintenance and repair of products previously sold to those customers and for engineering services. Professional services are less than 3% of our consolidated revenue. Revenue is typically recognized at a point in time when control transfers to the customer upon completion of professional services. These services generally involve a single distinct performance obligation. The consideration expected to be received in exchange for such services is normally the contractually stated amount. [/639]

[558]: Precision Medicine and Manufacturing [/558]
[559]: Precision Medicine and Manufacturing segment operating income was $69.3 million, or 24.5% of revenue, in 2023, versus $63.8 million, or 23.2% of revenue, in 2022. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $9.9 million, partially offset by an increase in restructuring, acquisition, and related costs of $3.2 million and an increase in SG&A expenses of $1.6 million. [/559]
[560]: 40 [/560]
[561]: Medical Solutions [/561]
[562]: Medical Solutions segment operating income was $41.9 million, or 12.9% of revenue, in 2023, versus $28.2 million, or 10.2% of revenue, in 2022. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $26.9 million and a decrease in amortization expenses of $1.0 million, partially offset by an increase in R&D spending of $8.5 million, an increase in SG&A expenses of $5.0 million and an increase in restructuring, acquisition and related costs of $0.8 million. [/562]
[535]: Medical Solutions [/535]
[536]: Medical Solutions segment gross profit for 2023 increased $26.9 million, or 24.8%, versus 2022, primarily due to an increase in both revenue and gross profit margin. Medical Solutions segment gross profit margin was 41.7% for 2023, compared with a gross profit margin of 39.1% for 2022. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to improved factory efficiency. [/536]
[537]: Robotics and Automation [/537]
[538]: Robotics and Automation segment gross profit for 2023 decreased $15.3 million, or 10.4%, versus 2022, primarily due to a decrease in revenue. Robotics and Automation segment gross profit margin was 47.9% for 2023, compared with a gross profit margin of 47.4% for 2022. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to improved factory efficiency and disciplined cost control. [/538]
[539]: Operating Expenses [/539]
[540]: The following table sets forth operating expenses for 2023 and 2022 (dollars in thousands): [/540]
[542]: 39 [/542]
[543]: Research and Development and Engineering Expenses [/543]
[544]: Research and development and engineering (“R&D”) expenses are primarily comprised of employee compensation and related expenses and cost of materials for R&D projects. [/544]
[630]: Operating and Finance Leases [/630]
[631]: We have entered into various lease agreements for office and manufacturing facilities, vehicles, and equipment used in the normal course of business. Undiscounted operating and finance lease obligations were $61.3 million, with $10.7 million payable within the next twelve months. See Note 12, “Leases,” in the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of our obligations and the timing of expected future payments. [/631]
[632]: 45 [/632]
[633]: Purchase Obligations [/633]
[634]: Purchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the goods or services. As of December 31, 2023, we had $127.5 million of purchase obligations, with $119.7 million payable within the next twelve months. [/634]
[635]: Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates [/635]
[636]: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, inventory valuation, impairment assessment and valuation of goodwill, intangible assets and tangible long-lived assets, valuation of contingent consideration obligations, accounting for income taxes, and accounting for loss contingencies. Actual results in the future could differ significantly from our estimates. [/636]
[794]: Table element - Text before table: On August 11, 2022 , the Company acquired 100 % of the outstanding shares of MPH Medical Devices S.R.O. (""MPH""), a Czech Republic-based manufacturer of medical consumables with plastics specialization in making medical disposable tube set products, for a total purchase price of € 21.8 million ($ 22.4 million), net of cash acquired. The acquisition was financed with borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility and cash available on hand. The addition of MPH has expanded the Company's capacity and capabilities in the medical disposable tube set products within the Medical Solutions reportable segment.
The acquisition of MPH has been accounted for as a business combination. The purchase price is allocated based upon a valuation of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. The fair value of the real property were based on valuations using an income and cost approach, specifically the direct capitalization method and the replacement value approaches. These approaches are subject to key assumptions including market rent estimates, capitalization rates, local multipliers and remaining useful life.  The sales comparison approach was not considered due to the limited data available on comparable properties.

[757]: 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies [/757]
[758]: Use of Estimates [/758]
[759]: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period in which such revisions are deemed to be necessary. The Company evaluates its estimates based on historical experience, current conditions, and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. [/759]
[760]: Foreign Currency Translation The financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries outside the U.S. have been translated into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated from foreign currencies into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the period. Accordingly, gains and losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements are reported as cumulative translation adjustments, a separate component of other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

In 2023, occupancy costs increased $3.9 million or 10 basis points as a percentage of revenue compared to 2022. This increase is primarily driven by an increase in fixed rents related to the sale-leaseback of 18 locations and the acquisition of five restaurants from a franchisee, mostly offset by reduced expenses related to net Company-owned restaurant closures.

[676]: Comprehensive Loss - Total comprehensive loss consists of the net loss and other gains and losses affecting stockholders' equity that, under U.S. GAAP, are excluded from net income. Other comprehensive (loss) income as presented in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for 2023, 2022, and 2021 consisted of the foreign currency translation adjustment resulting from the Company's Canadian franchise operations. [/676]
[677]: Stock-Based Compensation - The Company maintains several equity incentive plans under which it may grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, stock variable compensation, or other forms of awards granted or denominated in the Company's common stock or units of the Company's common stock, as well as cash variable compensation awards to employees, non-employees, directors, and consultants. The Company also maintains an employee stock purchase plan. The Company issues shares relating to stock-based compensation plans and the employee stock purchase plan from treasury shares. We recognize compensation expenses for only the portion of share-based awards that are expected to vest. Therefore, we apply estimated forfeiture rates that are derived from our historical forfeitures of similar awards when a Team Member leaves the Company. Deferred Compensation - The Company has assets and liabilities related to a deferred compensation plan. The assets of the deferred compensation plan are held in a rabbi trust, where they are invested in certain mutual funds that cover an investment spectrum range from equities to money market instruments. Fluctuations in the market value of the investments held in the trust result in the recognition of deferred compensation expense or income reported in Selling, general, and administrative expenses and recognition of investment gain or loss reported in Interest income and other, net, in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

[452]: Revenues [/452]
[454]: Restaurant revenue, which comprises primarily food and beverage sales, increased $44.1 million in 2023, or 3.6%, as compared to 2022. The fifty-third week in 2023 contributed approximately $24.5 million in restaurant revenue. Of the remaining $19.6 million increase, $18.8 million, or 1.6%, was due to an increase in comparable restaurant revenue and the remaining $0.7 million increase was due to non-comparable restaurants, primarily attributed to the Company's purchase of five restaurants from a Franchisee in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. The comparable restaurant revenue increase was driven by a 6.8% increase in average Guest check with a 5.2% decrease in Guest count. The increase in average Guest check resulted from a 7.5% increase in menu pricing and 0.9% decrease in discounts, partially offset by a 1.6% decrease in menu mix. The decrease in menu mix was primarily driven by Guests shifting visits from third party delivery platforms with elevated menu prices, to dine in visits at standard menu prices, and the removal of low Guest preference, but higher priced burger options. Dine-in sales comprised 75.0% of total food and beverage sales in 2023, as compared to 71.3% in 2022. [/454]
[391]: Our primary source of revenue is from the sale of food and beverages at Company-owned restaurants. We also earn revenue from royalties and fees from franchised restaurants. [/391]
[392]: Highlights for Fiscal 2023 Compared to Fiscal 2022 [/392]
[393]: • Total revenues are $1.3 billion, an increase of $37.5 million. [/393]
[394]: ◦ Comparable restaurant revenue (1) increased 1.6%. [/394]
[395]: ◦ Comparable restaurant dine-in sales (2) increased 6.9%. [/395]
[396]: ◦ The fifty-third week in 2023 contributed $24.5 million or 1.9% in restaurant revenue. [/396]
[397]: • Net loss is $21.2 million, a decrease of $57.7 million from a net loss of $78.9 million during 2022. [/397]
[398]: • Adjusted EBITDA (3) is $68.9 million, a $17.2 million increase. [/398]
[399]: • Completed two Sale-Leaseback transactions, generating net proceeds of $58.8 million and a gain, net of expenses of $29.4 million. [/399]
[400]: • Repaid $24.9 million of debt and repurchased $10.0 million of stock. [/400]
[401]: (1) Comparable restaurant revenue represents revenue from Company-owned restaurants that have operated five full quarters as of the 52 weeks ending December 24, 2023. The comparable restaurant base includes 406 restaurants out of the total 415 Company-owned restaurants. [/401]

[432]: The following table summarizes Income from Operations, and Restaurant Level Operating Profit for the fifty-three weeks ended December 31, 2023 and fifty-two weeks ended December 25, 2022: [/432]
[434]: The Company believes restaurant level operating profit is an important measure for management and investors because it is widely regarded in the restaurant industry as a useful metric by which to evaluate restaurant level operating efficiency and performance. The Company defines restaurant level operating profit to be income from operations less franchise royalties, fees and other revenue, plus other charges (gains), net, pre-opening costs, selling costs, general and administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization. The measure includes restaurant level occupancy costs that include fixed rents, percentage rents, common area maintenance charges, real estate and personal property taxes, general liability insurance, and other property costs, but excludes depreciation and amortization expense, substantially all of which is related to restaurant level assets, because such expenses represent historical sunk costs which do not reflect current cash outlay for the restaurants. The measure also excludes costs associated with selling, general, and administrative functions, pre-opening costs, as well as, other charges (gains), net because these costs are non-operating or nonrecurring and therefore not related to the ongoing operations of its restaurants. Restaurant level operating profit is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation, or as an alternative, to income (loss) from operations as an indicator of financial performance. Restaurant level operating profit as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies in the Company's industry. [/434]

                    Your answer should be formatted as a JSON object. Under the key 'answers' can be one or more JSON object(s), with key value pairs for the main question and the meta items. For the main question use the key 'main_question', for the meta items use their ID as key. Under the key 'sources', you should also provide the numbers of the text fragments you used to answer the question. For example your answer could look like this: {""answers"": [{""main_question"": ""123"", ""currency"": ""USD"", ""unit"": ""none"", ""year"": ""2021"", ""duration"": ""123""}], ""sources"": [241, 423]}

Goodwill is measured as of the acquisition date as the excess of consideration transferred over the net acquisition date fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The valuation of identifiable intangible assets reflects management's estimates based on, among other factors, use of established valuation methods, including, but not limited to, the multi-period excess earnings method income approach. Further estimates within these models include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows, including revenues and expenses, and applicable discount rates. These estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be recorded, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).

[379]: Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements [/379]
[380]: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Skechers U.S.A., Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. [/380]
[381]: We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) and our report dated February 28, 2024 expressed an adverse opinion thereon. [/381]
[523]: (9) Earnings Per Share [/523]
[524]: Basic EPS and diluted EPS are calculated by dividing net earnings by the following: for basic EPS, the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period; and for diluted EPS, the sum of the weighted-average number of both outstanding common shares and potentially dilutive common shares using the treasury stock method. [/524]
[525]: 42 [/525]
[526]: The calculation of EPS is as follows: [/526]
[528]: (10) Income Taxes [/528]
[529]: The Company’s earnings before income tax expense consists of the following: [/529]
[531]: Income tax consists of the following: [/531]
[533]: Income taxes differ from the statutory tax rates as applied to earnings before income taxes as follows: [/533]
[535]: 43 [/535]
[536]: The Company’s income tax expense (benefit) and effective income tax rate are significantly impacted by the mix of the Company’s domestic and foreign earnings (loss) before income taxes. In the non-U.S. jurisdictions in which the Company has operations, the applicable statutory rates are generally lower than in the U.S., ranging from 0 % to 35 % . The Company’s income tax expense (benefit) was calculated using the applicable rate for each jurisdiction applied to the Company’s pre-tax earnings (loss) while the Company’s effective tax rate is calculated by dividing income tax expense (benefit) by earnings before income taxes. For 2023 , the effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal and state combined statutory rate of approximately 25.1 %, primarily due to tax benefits related to earnings from foreign operations in jurisdictions imposing either lower tax rates on corporate earnings or no corporate income tax. [/536]
[441]: PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT [/441]
[442]: Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The Company reviews stores for impairment annually or when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values may be impaired. The Company did not record material impairment charges during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 or 2021 . The principal estimated useful lives are as follows: [/442]
[444]: GOODWILL Business acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method by assigning the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , the Company had $ 101.2 million and $ 93.5 million of goodwill included in the Wholesale segment. The increase of $ 7.7 million of goodwill included in the Wholesale segment relates to the acquisition of Sports Connection. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. See Note 14 – Business Combinations of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. [/444]
[382]: Basis for Opinion [/382]
[383]: These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. [/383]
[384]: We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. [/384]
[385]: Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. [/385]
[461]: 37 [/461]
[462]: The Company’s real estate leases may require additional payments for percentage rent, real estate taxes, or other occupancy-related costs. Percentage rent, a variable cost, is recognized in the consolidated financial statements when incurred and is based on the specific terms in the lease agreement. Real estate taxes and other occupancy-related costs are non-lease components. [/462]
[463]: Operating lease cost and other information: [/463]
[465]: The following table presents future lease payments as of December 31, 2023: [/465]
[467]: As of December 31, 2023, the Company has operating leases, primarily for new retail stores, that have not yet commenced which will generate additional ROU assets of $ 45.5 million. [/467]

[430]: BASIS OF PRESENTATION Skechers U.S.A., Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) designs, develops, markets and distributes footwear, apparel and accessories. The Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) as codified in the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain reclassifications of prior period balances have been made to conform to current presentation. [/430]
[431]: USE OF ESTIMATES The Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare these consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Significant areas requiring the use of estimates relate primarily to allowances for bad debts, returns and customer chargebacks, inventory reserves, litigation reserves and valuation of deferred income taxes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. [/431]

[650]: Table of Contents TOPBUILD CORP. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Business Combinations .  The purchase price for business combinations is allocated to the estimated fair values of acquired tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, and assumed liabilities, where applicable.  Additionally, we recognize customer relationships, trademarks and trade names, and non-compete agreements as identifiable intangible assets, which are recorded at fair value as of the transaction date. The fair value of the customer relationships intangible assets are determined by management using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach. Assumptions used in determining the fair value of the customer relationships intangible asset include forecasted revenue growth rate, customer attrition rate, and discount rate. The fair value of other intangible assets is determined primarily using current industry information.  Goodwill is recorded when consideration transferred exceeds the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities.  Measurement-period adjustments to assets acquired and liabilities assumed with a corresponding offset to goodwill are recorded in the period they occur, which may include up to one year from the acquisition date.  Contingent consideration is recorded at fair value at the acquisition date. ​ Cash and Cash Equivalents. We consider our highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash and cash equivalents. ​ Receivables, net. We do business with a significant number of customers, principally homebuilders and contractors.  We monitor our exposure for credit losses on our customer receivable balances and the credit worthiness of our customers on an on-going basis.  Expected credit losses are measured by segment using historical loss rate information adjusted for current conditions, with changes in the allowance recorded as a provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Expected losses are charged against the allowance when management believes a receivable is uncollectible. During downturns in our markets, declines in the financial condition and creditworthiness of customers impact the credit risk of the receivables involved and we have incurred additional expense related to customer defaults. Receivables, net are presented net of certain allowances, including allowance for credit losses. ​ Inventories. Inventories consist primarily of insulation and insulation accessories, rain gutters, garage doors, shower enclosures and bath accessories, shelving, glass and windows, and other products.  We value inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value, where cost is determined by the first in-first out cost method.  Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable cost of completion, disposal, and transportation.  Inventory value is evaluated at each balance sheet date to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. ​ Inventory provisions are recorded to reduce inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value for obsolete or slow moving inventory based on assumptions about future demand and marketability of products, the impact of new product introductions, inventory levels and turns, product spoilage, and specific identification of items such as product discontinuance, engineering/material changes, or regulatory-related changes.  Our inventory reserve balances were $ 10.7 million and $ 17.3 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  As of December 31, 2023, and 2022, primarily all inventory consisted of finished goods. ​ Property and Equipment, net. Property and equipment, net, including significant improvements to existing facilities, are recorded at cost.  Upon retirement or disposal, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Maintenance and repair costs are charged against earnings as incurred.  Gains and losses on the disposal of equipment are included in selling, general, and administrative expense. ​ We review our property and equipment as an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value of property and equipment is below its fair value.  If the carrying amount is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows, we would recognize an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the current fair value.  Further, we evaluate the remaining useful lives of property and equipment at each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining depreciation periods. ​ 44 [/650]
[590]: Table of Contents Item 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA ​ Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm ​ To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of TopBuild Corp. Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TopBuild Corp. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of changes in shareholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO . Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions . Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that 36 ​ [/590]

[649]: Table of Contents TOPBUILD CORP. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation. TopBuild is a Delaware corporation and trades on the NYSE under the symbol “BLD.” We report our business in two segments: Installation and Specialty Distribution.  Our Installation segment primarily installs insulation and other building products.  Our Specialty Distribution segment primarily sells and distributes insulation and other building products.  Our segments are based on our operating units, for which financial information is regularly evaluated by our Chief Operating Decision Maker. ​ Financial Statement Presentation. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been developed in conformity with GAAP.  All intercompany transactions between the TopBuild entities have been eliminated. ​ Use of Estimates and Assumptions in the Preparation of Financial Statements. The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. ​ Revenue Recognition. Revenue is disaggregated between our Installation and Specialty Distribution segments. A reconciliation of disaggregated revenue by segment is included in Note 8 – Segment Information . ​ We recognize revenue for our Installation segment over time as the related performance obligation is satisfied with respect to each particular order within a given customer’s contract. Progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation is measured using a cost-to-cost measure of progress method. The cost input is based on the amount of material installed at that customer’s location and the associated labor costs, as compared to the total expected cost for the particular order.  The total expected cost is a significant estimate in the revenue recognition process, requires judgment, and is subject to variability throughout the duration of the contract as a result of contract modifications and other circumstances impacting job completion. Generally, this results in revenue being recognized as the customer is able to receive and utilize the benefits provided by our services. Each contract contains one or more individual orders, which are based on services delivered. When material and installation services are bundled in a contract, we combine these items into one performance obligation as the overall promise is to transfer the combined item. ​ Revenue from our Specialty Distribution segment is recognized when title to products and risk of loss transfers to our customers.  This represents the point in time when the customer is able to direct the use of and obtain substantially all the benefits from the product"

[622]: EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA [/622]
[623]: To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, we use non-U.S. GAAP financial measures
            including EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. Adjusted
            EBITDA is used by management to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses and planning purposes and is presented to our Board of Directors. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are appropriate measures of
            operating performance because they eliminate the impact of expenses that do not relate to operating performance. In addition, our debt instruments contain covenants which use Adjusted EBITDA calculations. [/623]

[606]: Net Sales . For the year ended December 31, 2022, overall net sales decreased to $415.0 million from $445.5 million
            for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $30.5 million or 6.8%. The decrease in net sales was primarily driven by decreased sales volume in the Creative Distribution Solutions segment. [/606]
[607]: For the year ended December 31, 2022, net sales in the Zig-Zag Products segment increased to $190.4 million from $176.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $13.9
            million or 7.9%. The increase in net sales was by led by double-digit growth in sales of U.S. rolling papers and e-commerce, other smoking accessories, and Canadian businesses partially offset by a double-digit decline in the wraps business. [/607]
[815]: The Company records an allowance for sales returns, based principally on historical volume and return rates, which is included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated
      balance sheets. The Company records sales incentives, which consist of consumer incentives and trade promotion activities, as a reduction in revenues (a portion of which is based on amounts estimated as being due to wholesalers, retailers and
      consumers at the end of the period) based principally on historical volume and utilization rates. Expected payments for sales incentives are included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. [/815]
[816]: A further requirement of ASC 606 is for entities to disaggregate revenue recognized from contracts with customers into categories that depict how the nature, amount,
      timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. Company management views business performance through segments that closely resemble the performance of major product lines. Thus, the primary and most useful
      disaggregation of the Company’s contract revenue for decision making purposes is the disaggregation by segment which can be found in Note 20, “Segment Information”. An additional disaggregation of contract revenue by sales channel can be found within
      Note 20 as well. [/816]

                    This is the available data to answer the question (in the following, if tables have empty cells, they are omitted, if a cell spans several columns, values might be repeated for each cell):
[661]: Included in revenues are fees charged to customers for shipping, handling, and delivery services. Such revenues amounted to $ 11.0 million and $ 11.3 million for 2023 and 2022, respectively. [/661]
[662]: Revenues from hosted software licensing activities are recognized ratably over the term of the license. Revenues from software licensing activities comprise less than 2.5 % of the Company’s consolidated revenues during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. [/662]
[663]: Management provides for returns, discounts and allowances based on historic experience and adjusts such allowances as considered necessary. [/663]
[664]: Comprehensive Income (Loss) The Company’s comprehensive income (loss) includes foreign currency translation adjustments, net of taxes. Asset and liability accounts of international operations are translated into the Company’s functional currency, U.S. dollars, at current rates. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average currency rate for the fiscal year. [/664]
[665]: Segment and Geographic Reporting [/665]
[666]: The provisions of ASC 280, Segment Reporting , require public companies to report financial and descriptive information about their reportable operating segments. The Company identifies operating segments based on the various business activities that earn revenue and incur expense and whose operating results are reviewed by the Company's Chief Executive Officer, who is the Company's chief operating decision maker. Because its operating segments have similar products and services, classes of customers, production processes, distribution methods and economic characteristics, the Company operates as a single reportable segment. [/666]
[667]: The Company recognizes revenues in geographic areas based on the location to which the product was shipped or services have been rendered. See table below for revenues and property and equipment, net, attributable to the Company’s U.S. operations and foreign operations. [/667]
[669]: F-15 [/669]
[670]: Advertising and Shipping and Handling Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and approximated $ 0.7 million during 2023 and 2022. Shipping and handling costs incurred by the Company are included in cost of sales. [/670]
[671]: Stock-Based Compensation [/671]
[672]: The Company applies the Black-Scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of share-based payments to employees, which is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. [/672]
[673]: Total stock-based compensation for 2023 and 2022, was $ 2.2 million and $ 1.8 million, respectively, and was recorded in selling, general, and administrative expenses, consistent with the classification of the underlying salaries. In accordance with ASC 718, Income Taxes , any excess tax benefit resulting from stock-based compensation, in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, are classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity.

[367]: EBITDA represents net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA margin is a non-GAAP measure calculated by dividing EBITDA by net sales. [/367]
[368]: We use EBITDA and EBITDA margin to measure and compare the performance of our operating divisions. Our operating divisions financial performance includes all of the operating activities except debt and taxation which are managed at the corporate level for U.S. operating divisions. We use EBITDA and EBITDA margin to compare the performance of our operating divisions and to measure performance for determining consolidated-level compensation. In addition, we use EBITDA and EBITDA margin to evaluate potential acquisitions and potential capital expenditures. [/368]
[369]: EBITDA and EBITDA margin have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are as follows: [/369]
[370]: • They do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures and contractual commitments; [/370]
[477]: 34 [/477]
[478]: financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured and tax position taken or expected to be taken on its tax return. To the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. We report tax-related interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense. [/478]

[684]: Sales Taxes The Company bills sales taxes, as applicable, to its customers. The Company acts as an agent and bills, collects, and remits the sales tax to the proper government jurisdiction. The sales taxes are accounted for on a net basis, and therefore are not included as part of the Company’s revenue. [/684]
[685]: F-16 [/685]
[686]: Earnings Per Share [/686]
[687]: The Company accounts for earnings per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings Per Share. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to ARC by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed similarly to basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if common shares subject to outstanding options and acquisition rights had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. Common share equivalents are excluded from the computation if their effect is anti-dilutive. There were 4.1 million and 3.2 million common shares excluded from the calculation of diluted net income attributable to ARC per common share as their effect would have been anti-dilutive for 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company’s common share equivalents consist of stock options issued under the Company’s Stock Plan. [/687]
[444]: Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates [/444]
[445]: Our management prepares financial statements in conformity with GAAP. When we prepare these consolidated financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to accounts receivable, inventories, deferred tax assets, goodwill and intangible assets, long-lived assets and leases. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates.

 [/604]
[644]: Property and Equipment, net [/644]
[645]: Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, as follows: [/645]
[647]: Assets acquired under capital lease arrangements are included in machinery and equipment, are recorded at the present value of the minimum lease payments, and are depreciated using the straight-line method over the life of the asset or term of the lease, whichever is shorter. Expenses for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred, while renewals and betterments are capitalized. Gains or losses on the sale or disposal of property and equipment are reflected in operating income. [/647]
[648]: The Company accounts for software costs developed for internal use in accordance with ASC 350-40, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software, which requires companies to capitalize certain qualifying costs incurred during the application development stage of the related software development project. The primary use of this software is for internal use and, accordingly, such capitalized software development costs are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the economic lives of the related products not to exceed three years . The Company’s machinery and equipment (see Note 4, Property and Equipment, Net ) includes $ 1.9 million and $ 1.7 million of capitalized software development costs as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, net of accumulated amortization of $ 24.2 million and $ 23.3 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Depreciation expense includes the amortization of capitalized software development costs which amounted to $ 0.9 million and $ 1.0 million, during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. [/648]
[679]: For additional information, see Note 9, Employee Stock Purchase Plan and Stock Plan. [/679]
[680]: Research and Development Expenses [/680]
[681]: Research and development activities relate to costs associated with the design and testing of new technology or enhancements and maintenance to existing technology. Such costs are expensed as incurred are primarily recorded to cost of sales. In total, research and development amounted to $ 6.2 million and $ 6.5 million, during 2023 and 2022, respectively. [/681]
[682]: Noncontrolling Interest [/682]
[683]: The Company accounted for its investment in UDS under the purchase method of accounting, in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations . UDS has been consolidated in the Company’s financial statements from the date of acquisition. Noncontrolling interest, which represents the 35 % noncontrolling interest in UDS, is reflected on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. In May of 2022, the Company completed an $ 11.2 million capital distribution from its Chinese JV. As the Company is 65 % owner, $ 7.3 million came to the Company's US operations, and 35 % or $ 3.9 million went to the JV partner, thus resulting in a $ 3.9 million decrease in the Company's consolidated cash and noncontrolling interest balance sheet accounts in 2022. [/683]
[364]: EBITDA margin decreased to 11.3% in 2023 from 13.7% in 2022. Excluding the effect of the site remediation expense and stock-based compensation, adjusted EBITDA margin decreased slightly to 13.6% in 2023 from 14.3% in 2022. The decrease is largely attributable to lower sales and an increase in labor costs. [/364]
[365]: Non-GAAP Financial Measures [/365]
[366]: EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share presented in this report are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America or GAAP. These measures are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income, net income margin, income from operations, diluted earnings per share or any other performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as a measure of our liquidity. We have presented these measures because we consider them important supplemental measures of our performance and liquidity. We believe investors may also find these measures meaningful, given how our management makes use of them. The following is a discussion of our use of these measures. [/366]
[339]: Equipment and Supplies . Equipment and Supplies sales decreased by $2.1 million, or 11.5%, in 2023, compared to 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by the ongoing economic slowdown in China, which decreased sales from UNIS Document Solutions Co. Ltd, or UDS, our Chinese joint venture. Equipment and Supplies sales continue to decline in the U.S. as well. We attribute the decrease in sales to our customers' reluctance to acquire equipment while interest rates remain high and, in certain markets including China, economic activity remains depressed. Equipment and Supplies sales derived from UDS, were $1.7 million in 2023, as compared to $2.5 million in 2022. Equipment and Supplies sales represented approximately 6% of total net sales for 2023 for 2022, respectively. [/339]
[340]: Gross Profit [/340]
[341]: Gross profit decreased to $94.4 million in 2023, compared to $96.0 million in 2022. Despite a sales decrease of $4.8 million in 2023, gross profit decreased by just $1.6 million. Gross margin remained flat at 33.6% in 2023, compared to 2022. Gross margin stability was driven by improved efficiency in our cost structure and a reduction in depreciation expense of $2.6 million. Offsetting these cost reductions were increased labor expenses related to the growth in Scanning and Digital Imaging Services, as well as wage inflation pressures across our workforce during 2023. [/341]
[634]: Purchases from the Company’s three largest vendors during 2023 and 2022 comprised approximately 35 % of the Company’s total purchases of inventory and supplies. [/634]
[635]: Allowance for Credit Losses [/635]
[636]: The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of the financial condition of its customers, monitors collections and payments from customers, and generally does not require collateral. The Company provides for the possible inability to collect accounts receivable by recording an allowance for credit losses. The Company writes off accounts receivable balances when it is considered uncollectible. The Company estimates the allowance for credit losses based on historical experience, aging of accounts receivable, and information regarding the credit worthiness of its customers. Additionally, the Company provides an allowance for returns and discounts based on historical experience. The allowance for credit losses activity was as follows: [/636]
[638]: (1) Deductions represent uncollectible accounts written-off net of recoveries. [/638]
[655]: Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the Company's customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company is expected to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company applied practical expedients related to unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which the Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it has the right to invoice for services performed. [/655]
[656]: Net sales of the Company’s principal services and products were as follows: [/656]
[658]: Digital Printing consists of professional services and software services to (i) re-produce and distribute large-format and small-format documents in either black and white or color (“Ordered Prints”) and (ii) specialized graphic color printing. Substantially, all of the Company’s revenue from Digital Printing comes from professional services to re-produce Ordered Prints. Sales of Ordered Prints are initiated through a customer order or quote and are governed by established terms and conditions agreed upon at the onset of the customer relationship. Revenue is recognized when the performance obligation under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the re-produced Ordered Prints. Transfer of control occurs at a specific point-in-time, when the Ordered Prints are delivered to the customer’s site or handed to the customer for walk in orders. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. Taxes collected concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. MPS consists of placement, management, and optimization of print and imaging equipment in the customers' offices, job sites, and other facilities. MPS relieves the Company’s customers of the burden of purchasing print equipment and related supplies and maintaining print devices and print networks, and shifts their costs to a “per-use” basis. MPS is supported by the Company's hosted proprietary technology, Abacus ® , which allows customers to capture, control, manage, print, and account for their documents. Under its MPS contracts, the Company is paid a fixed rate per unit for each print produced (per-use), often referred to as a “click charge”. MPS sales are driven by the ongoing print needs of the Company’s customers at their facilities. Upon the issuance of ASC 842, Leases, the Company concluded that certain of its MPS arrangements, which had previously been accounted for as service revenue under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, are accounted for as operating leases under ASC 842. The pattern of revenue recognition for the Company's MPS revenue has remained substantially unchanged following the adoption of ASC 842. See Note 7, Leasing, for additional information. Scanning and Digital Imaging, combines software and professional services to facilitate the capture, management, access and retrieval of documents and information that have been produced in the past. Scanning and Digital Imaging includes the Company's hosted SKYSITE ® software and ARC Facilities solution to organize, search and retrieve documents, as well as the [/658]
[583]: Our audit of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

[333]: Net Sales [/333]
[334]: Net sales in 2023 decreased 1.7%, compared to 2022. The decrease in net sales was primarily driven by the decrease in sales from Digital Printing and Equipment & Supplies, partially offset by the year-over-year increase in sales from Scanning and Digital Imaging services. [/334]
[335]: Digital Printing . Sales of Digital Printing services in 2023 decreased by $4.7 million, or 2.7%, compared to 2022. Year-over-year sales increased in digital color graphic printing from new and existing customers, and we experienced continuing demand for digital color graphic printing across most of our customer base. This growth was offset by the decrease of sales in digital plan printing for construction, which we attribute to less activity and lower spending on new building projects due to higher interest rates and increased costs of capital. Digital Printing services represented 60% and 61% of total net sales for 2023 and 2022, respectively. [/335]

[745]: Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting [/745]
[746]: A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. [/746]
[882]: Stock-based Compensation Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. The Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period. [/882]
[883]: Comprehensive Income or Loss Comprehensive income for all periods presented was the same as net income attributable to California Water Service Group. [/883]
[884]: Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income The Company did not have any accumulated other comprehensive income or loss transactions as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. [/884]
[885]: New Accounting Standards In November 2023, the Financial Standards Accounting Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures which expands annual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for the Company's annual periods beginning January 1, 2024, and for interim periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. The guidance requires retrospective presentation of all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the potential effect that the updated standard will have on its financial statement disclosures. [/885]
[470]: The accuracy of our judgments and estimates about financial and accounting matters will affect our operating results and financial condition. [/470]
[471]: We make certain estimates and judgments in preparing our financial statements regarding, among others: [/471]
[472]: • the useful life of intangible rights; [/472]
[473]: • the number of years to depreciate certain assets; [/473]
[474]: • amounts to set aside for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory obsolescence, and uninsured losses; [/474]
[475]: • our legal exposure and the appropriate accrual for claims, including medical claims and workers' compensation claims; [/475]
[476]: • future costs and assumptions for pensions and other postretirement benefits; [/476]
[477]: • regulatory recovery of regulatory assets; [/477]
[478]: • possible tax uncertainties; and [/478]
[479]: • projected collections of WRAM and MCBA receivables or receivables under subsequent recovery mechanisms, such as MWRAM and ICBA. [/479]
[480]: The quality and accuracy of those estimates and judgments may have an impact on our operating results and financial condition. [/480]
[481]: In addition, we must estimate unbilled revenues and costs as of the end of each accounting period. If our estimates are not accurate, we would be required to make an adjustment in a future period. Accounting rules permit us to use expense balancing accounts and memorandum accounts that include cost changes to us that are different from amounts incorporated into the rates approved by the Commissions. These accounts result in expenses and revenues being recognized in periods other than in which they occurred. [/481]
[687]: The following tables present summarized financial information of the Issuer subsidiary and the Guarantor. The information presented below excludes eliminations necessary to arrive at the information on a consolidated basis. In presenting the summarized financial statements, the equity method of accounting has been applied to the Guarantor interests in the Issuer. The summarized information excludes financial information of the Non-issuers, including earnings from and investments in these entities. [/687]
[690]: Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements [/690]
[691]: We do not have commitments or obligations, including contingent obligations, arising from arrangements with unconsolidated entities or persons that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, cash requirements, or capital resources even when the arrangement results in no obligation being reported in our consolidated balance sheets.

Maintenance of utility plant is charged to operating expenses as incurred. Maintenance projects are not accrued for in advance. [/840]

[809]: The measurement of sales to customers is generally based on the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, the Company estimates consumption since the date of the last meter reading and a corresponding unbilled revenue is recognized. The estimate is based upon the number of unbilled days that month and the average daily customer billing rate from the previous month (which fluctuates based upon customer usage). [/809]
[810]: Contract terms are generally short-term and at will by customers and, as a result, no separate financing component is recognized for the Company's collections from customers, which generally require payment within 30 days of billing. The Company applies judgment, based principally on historical payment experience, in estimating its customers’ ability to pay. [/810]
[811]: Certain customers are not billed for volumetric consumption, but are instead billed a flat rate at the beginning of each monthly service period. The amount billed is initially deferred and subsequently recognized over the monthly service period, as the performance obligation is satisfied. The deferred revenue balance or contract liability, which is included in ""other accrued liabilities"" on the consolidated balance sheets, is inconsequential. [/811]

[1058]: NOTE 13. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS [/1058]
[1059]: The accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures provides a single definition of fair value and requires certain disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value. A hierarchical framework for disclosing the observability of the inputs utilized in measuring assets and liabilities at fair value is established by this guidance. The three levels in the hierarchy are described in Note 11 - Employee Benefit Plans. [/1059]

[821]: Table element - Text before table: Regulatory balancing account revenue Regulatory balancing account revenue is revenue related to revenue mechanisms authorized in California by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), which the Company recognizes as revenue when it is objectively determinable, probable of recovery and expected to be collected within 24 months following the end of the accounting period. Regulatory balancing account revenues are not considered contracts with customers. To the extent that revenue is estimated to be collectible beyond 24 months, recognition is deferred. Due to a delay in resolution of Cal Water's most recent general rate case filing in July of 2021 (2021 GRC), the Company did not recognize a benefit from regulatory revenue mechanisms in 2023. For 2022, the Company's authorized regulatory revenue mechanisms included the Water Revenue Adjustment Mechanism (WRAM). The WRAM decoupled revenue from the volume of the sales and allowed the Company to recognize the adopted level of volumetric revenues. The variance between adopted volumetric revenues and actual billed volumetric revenues for metered accounts was recorded as regulatory balancing account revenue. The WRAM concluded on December 31, 2022. Regulatory balancing accounts also includes revenue that is recognized for balancing accounts when it is probable that future recovery of previously incurred costs or future refunds that are to be credited to customers will occur through the ratemaking process. These mechanisms, such as the Modified Cost Balancing Account (MCBA), Conservation Expense Balancing Account (CEBA), Pension Cost Balancing Account (PCBA), and Health Cost Balancing Account (HCBA), generally provide for recovery of the adopted levels of expenses for purchased water, purchased power, pump taxes, water conservation program costs, pensions, and health care. Variances between adopted and actual costs were recorded as regulatory balancing account revenue in 2022. In 2023, in connection with the CPUC's decision to discontinue the use of the WRAM, the variances for CEBA, HCBA, and PCBA are recorded against the originating expense. The MCBA concluded on December 31, 2022. The CPUC issued a decision effective August 27, 2020 requiring that Class A companies submitting GRC filings after the effective date be (i) precluded from proposing the use of a full decoupling WRAM in their next GRCs and (ii) allowed the use of a Monterey-Style Water Revenue Adjustment Mechanism (MWRAM). In addition, the CPUC's decision allowed for Incremental Cost Balancing Accounts (ICBAs) to replace the MCBA. The MWRAM tracks the difference between the revenue received for actual metered sales through the tiered volumetric rate and the revenue that would have been received with the same actual metered sales if a uniform rate had been in effect. The ICBA tracks differences between the authorized per-unit prices of water production costs and actual per-unit prices of water production costs. Cal Water complied with this decision in its 2021 GRC and the M"

[546]: the entity’s economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity or right to receive benefits from the entity that could be potentially significant to the VIE is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the VIE. In accordance with ASC 810, the Company performs ongoing reassessments of whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The financial statements of the VIEs for which the Company is considered to be the primary beneficiary, if any, are consolidated in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The noncontrolling interests attributable to other beneficiaries of the VIEs are included as noncontrolling interests in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Property and Equipment, Net Property and equipment, net are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives of assets range from 1 to 15 years. Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Earnest Money Deposits In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into land and lot option contracts to procure land for the construction of homes in the future. Pursuant to these option contracts, the Company generally provides a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future, usually at predetermined prices. Such contracts enable the Company to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties or unconsolidated entities until the Company has determined whether and when to exercise its option, which reduces the Company’s financial risk associated with long-term land holdings. Option deposits and pre-acquisition costs (such as environmental testing, surveys, engineering, and entitlement costs) are capitalized if the costs are directly identifiable with the land under option and acquisition of the property is probable. These costs are reclassified to inventory upon taking title to the land. The Company writes off deposits and pre-acquisition costs if it becomes probable that the Company will not proceed with the project or recover the capitalized costs. Such decisions take into consideration changes in local market conditions, the timing of required land takedowns, the availability and best use of necessary incremental capital, and other factors. Under ASC 810, a non-refundable deposit paid to an entity is deemed to be a variable interest that will absorb some or all of the entity’s expected losses if they occur and, as such, the Company’s land and lot option contracts are considered variable interests. The Company’s option contract deposits along with any related pre-acquisition costs represent the Company’s maximum exposure to the land seller if the Company elects not to purchase the optioned property. Therefore, whenever the Company enters into an option or purchase contract with an entity and makes a non-refundable deposit, a VIE assessment is performed. However, the Company generally has little control or power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance due to the Company’s lack of an equity interest in them. Additionally, creditors of the VIE typically have no material recourse against the Company, and the Company does not provide financial or other support to these VIEs other than as stipulated in the option contracts. In accordance with ASC 810, the Company performs ongoing reassessments of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Intangible Assets Intangible assets, net consists of the estimated fair value of the acquired trade name, net of amortization. The trade name has a definite life and is amortized over ten years. Intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The impairment loss recorded would be the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value would be determined using a discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation technique. Goodwill The excess of the purchase price of a business acquisition over the net fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is capitalized as goodwill in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). The allocation to goodwill [/546]
[359]: Selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue increased by 1.6% for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to an increase in brokerage commissions. [/359]
[360]: Builder Operations [/360]
[361]: Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue for builder operations increased from 9.5% to 10.9% due to an increase in brokerage commissions. Builder operations expenditures include salaries, sales commissions, and community costs such as advertising and marketing expenses, rent, professional fees, and non-capitalized property taxes. [/361]
[362]: Corporate, Other and Unallocated [/362]
[363]: Selling, general and administrative expense for the corporate, other and unallocated non-operating segment for the year ended December 31, 2023 was income of $0.3 million, compared to income of $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The change was driven primarily by an increase in capitalized overhead adjustments that are not allocated to our builder operations and land development segments. [/363]

[555]: The Company also pays builder incentives to employees which are based on the time it takes to build individual homes, as well as quality inspection completion and customer satisfaction. The builder incentives do not represent incremental costs that would require capitalization as we would incur these costs whether or not we sold the home. As such, we recognize builder incentives as expense at the time they are incurred and paid. Advertising costs, sales salaries and certain costs associated with model homes, such as signage, do not qualify for capitalization under ASC 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs - Contracts with Customers , as they are not incremental costs of obtaining a contract. As such, we expense these costs to selling, general and administrative expense as incurred. Costs incurred related to model home furnishings and sales office construction are capitalized and included in property and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Selling, general and administrative expense represents salaries, benefits, share-based compensation, property taxes on finished homes, sales commissions, depreciation, amortization, advertising and marketing, rent, and other administrative items, and is recorded in the period incurred. Advertising Expense The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs are included in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income. Advertising expense for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 totaled $ 2.4 million, $ 1.2 million and $ 1.3 million, respectively. Interest Expense Interest expense consists primarily of interest costs incurred on our debt that are not capitalized, and amortization of debt issuance costs. We capitalize interest costs incurred to inventory during development and other qualifying activities. Debt issuance costs are capitalized to inventory over the term of the underlying debt using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest rate method for our senior unsecured notes and notes payable, in accordance with our interest capitalization policy. All interest costs were capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. Net Income Attributable to Green Brick Partners, Inc. per Common Share Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income allocated to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period, adjusted for non-vested shares of restricted stock awards during each period. Net income allocated to common stockholders is net income adjusted for preferred stock dividends including dividends declared and cumulative dividends related to the current dividend period that have not been declared as of period end. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using the treasury stock method and includes the effect of all dilutive securities, including stock options, restricted stock awards and performance restricted stock units. The Company’s restricted stock awards have the right to receive forfeitable dividends on an equal basis with common stock and its performance restricted stock units do not participate in dividends with common stock. As such, these stock awards are not considered participating securities that must be included in the calculation of net income per common share using the two-class method. Cost Recognition Lot acquisition, materials, direct costs, interest and indirect costs related to the acquisition, development, and construction of lots and homes are capitalized. Direct costs of developing residential lots are allocated evenly to all applicable lots. Indirect construction cost allocations are based on a budgeted amount, then allocated to each home as it closes. If actual costs exceed the budget, then actual costs are recognized, or the budgeted amount increased. Capitalized costs of residential lots are expensed when the related revenue is recognized. Non-capitalizable costs in connection with developed lots and completed homes and other selling and administrative costs are expensed when incurred. Share-Based Compensation The Company measures and accounts for share-based awards in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation . The Company expenses share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including stock options, [/555]

[729]: Our contracts with homebuyers have a duration of less than one year. As such, the Company uses the practical expedient as allowed under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , and has not disclosed the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations as of the end of the reporting period. [/729]
[730]: 12. SEGMENT INFORMATION [/730]
[731]: The Company has three reportable segments - Builder operations Central, Builder operations Southeast, and Land Development. Builder operations Central represents operations by our builders in Texas, whereas Builder operations Southeast represents operations by our builders in Georgia and Florida. The Land Development segment acquires land for the development of residential lots that are transferred to our controlled builders or sold to third party homebuilders. The operations of the Company’s builders and land development were aggregated in three reportable segments based on similar economic characteristics, including geography, housing products, class of homebuyer, regulatory environments, and methods used to construct and sell homes. Corporate operations are reported as a non-operating segment and include activities which support the Company’s builder operations, land development, title and mortgage operations through the centralization of certain administrative functions, such as finance, treasury, information technology and human resources, as well as development of strategic initiatives. Unallocated corporate expenses are reported in the corporate, other and unallocated segment as these activities do not share a majority of aggregation criteria with either the builder operations or land development segments. While the operations of Challenger meet the criteria for an operating segment, they do not meet the quantitative thresholds of ASC 280, Segment Reporting (“ASC 280”) to be separately reported and disclosed. As such, Challenger’s results are included within the corporate, other and unallocated segment. Green Brick Title, LLC (“Green Brick Title”) and BHome Mortgage operations are not economically similar to either builder operations or land development and do not meet the quantitative thresholds of ASC 280 to be separately reported and disclosed. As such, these entities’ results are included within the corporate, other and unallocated segment. Operations of EJB River Holdings and GBTM Sendera do not meet the criteria for an operating segment, and they do not meet the quantitative thresholds of ASC 280 to be separately reported and disclosed. As such, these results are included within the corporate, other and unallocated segment. Operational results of each reportable segment are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have been achieved had the reportable segment been an independent, stand-alone entity during the periods presented. [/731]
[479]: Critical Audit Matters [/479]
[480]: The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. [/480]
[481]: Evaluation of Inventory for Impairment [/481]
[482]: As described in Notes 1 and 4 to the financial statements, the Company’s inventory, including homes completed or under construction and land and lots inventory was $1,533 million as of December 31, 2023. The Company performs impairment testing quarterly to determine whether events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of its inventory may not be recoverable. [/482]
[483]: If future results are not consistent with the Company’s assumptions and estimates, including future events, such as deterioration of market conditions or significant changes in the absorption rates, changes in the assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of indicators of potential impairment. [/483]
[484]: We identified the evaluation of potential indicators of impairment for inventory as a critical audit matter. This is due to a high degree of auditor judgment that was involved in evaluating management’s assumptions and judgments regarding whether [/484]

[549]: represents the excess of the purchase price, including contingent consideration, over the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill results primarily from operational synergies expected from the business combination. Goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if certain impairment indicators are present. A goodwill impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company generally elects to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that fair value of the reporting level is less than its carrying amount. Qualitative factors include adverse macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, reporting unit specific events and entity specific events. If, after completing a qualitative assessment, the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company must perform a quantitative test to evaluate goodwill for impairment. To perform a quantitative test, the Company calculates the fair value of the reporting unit and compares that amount to the reporting unit’s carrying value. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined by using generally accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models and market multiple analysis. The Company’s valuation methodology for assessing impairment would require management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance. The Company recognizes goodwill impairment, if any, as the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Warranties The Company offers homeowners a comprehensive third-party warranty on each home. Homes are generally covered by a six-to-ten-year warranty for qualified and defined structural defects, one year for defects and products used, and two years for electrical, plumbing, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning parts and labor. The Company accrues an estimate of its exposure to warranty claims based on both current and historical home closings data and warranty costs incurred. A warranty accrual is made with the closing of a home and it is included within accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets. Any legal costs associated with loss contingencies related to warranties are expensed as incurred. Debt Issuance Costs Debt issuance costs represent costs incurred related to the senior unsecured notes, revolving secured and unsecured credit facilities, and notes payable, including amendments thereto, and reduce the carrying amount of debt on the consolidated balance sheets. These costs are subject to capitalization to inventory over the term of the related debt facility using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest rate method for our senior unsecured notes and notes payable. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest in Equity of Consolidated Subsidiary Redeemable noncontrolling interest in equity of consolidated subsidiary represents equity related to a put option held by a minority shareholder of a subsidiary. Based on the put option structure, the minority shareholder’s interest in the controlled subsidiary is classified as a redeemable noncontrolling interest on the consolidated balance sheets. The accretion of the redeemable noncontrolling interest to its estimated redemption value is recorded in additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets if the estimated redemption value, net of accretion, is greater than the current value of the noncontrolling interest capital account.

[480]: Gross profit margin is gross profit as a percentage of net sales. Gross profit margin is impacted by costs of raw material, product mix, salary and wage inflation, production costs, shipping and handling costs, and import duties, all of which can vary. [/480]
[481]: Selling, general and administrative expense [/481]
[482]: Our SG&A includes expenses arising from activities in selling, marketing, technical and customer services, warranty, warehousing, and administrative expenses. Other than warranty and variable compensation, SG&A is generally not directly proportional to net sales. [/482]
[483]: Research, development and engineering expense [/483]
[484]: The Company conducts RD&E activities in its own facilities. These expenses consist primarily of salaries, supplies and overhead costs related to the active development of new products, enhanced product applications and improved manufacturing and value engineering of existing products. [/484]
[485]: Generally, RD&E costs are expensed as incurred. Certain RD&E costs applicable to the development of software are capitalized and amortized over the expected life of the product. [/485]
[705]: Revenue Recognition [/705]
[706]: As described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company primarily sells pool equipment to its customers. The Company’s consolidated net sales were $992.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. An arrangement with a customer contains a single performance obligation for sale of the products. Transfer of the individual product is considered the performance obligation. The Company ships its products via Free on Board (FOB) shipping point and recognizes revenue at the point-in-time of shipment to the customer. The Company recognizes revenue net of rebates and other discounts. [/706]
[707]: The principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition is a critical audit matter is a high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures related to the Company’s revenue recognition. Also, as disclosed by management, material weaknesses existed during the year related to the Company’s control environment, control activities, and information technology general controls, which impacted this matter.

[551]: (Dollars in thousands) [/551]
[553]: (a) See “—Non-GAAP Reconciliation.” [/553]
[554]: Year-over-year net sales decrease was driven by the following: [/554]
[556]: Net sales [/556]
[557]: Net sales decreased to $823.3 million in Fiscal Year 2023 from $1,108.9 million in Fiscal Year 2022, a decrease of $285.6 million or 25.8%. [/557]
[558]: This decrease was primarily the result of a decline in volume, partially offset by increases in price and the favorable impact of acquisitions. The decline in volume was primarily the result of the moderation of end market demand trends due to macroeconomic factors and distribution channel destocking. The increase in the net price was due to price increases enacted to offset inflation. [/558]
[559]: Gross profit and Gross profit margin [/559]
[560]: Gross profit decreased to $410.6 million in Fiscal Year 2023 from $514.9 million in Fiscal Year 2022, a decrease of $104.3 million or 20.2%. [/560]
[561]: Gross profit margin increased to 49.9% in Fiscal Year 2023 from 46.4% in Fiscal Year 2022, an increase of 350 basis points, primarily due to the management of our manufacturing costs, including reduced costs specifically in freight and tariffs, partially offset by lower operating leverage. [/561]
[592]: Use of the terms EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, total segment income, adjusted segment income and adjusted segment income margin may differ from similar measures reported by other companies. EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, total segment income, adjusted segment income and adjusted segment income margin are not calculated in the same manner by all companies, and accordingly, are not necessarily comparable to similarly entitled measures of other companies and may not be an appropriate measure for performance relative to other companies. EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, total segment income and adjusted segment income should not be construed as indicators of a company’s operating performance in isolation from, or as a substitute for, net income (loss), operating income and segment income, which are prepared in accordance with GAAP. We have presented EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, total segment income, adjusted segment income and adjusted segment income margin solely as supplemental disclosure because we believe it allows for a more complete analysis of results of operations. In the future we may incur expenses such as those added back to calculate adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted segment income should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by these items. [/592]
[486]: Amortization of intangible assets [/486]
[487]: Customer relationships, trademarks and other intangible assets arising from business combinations are amortized over their expected useful lives of 5-20 years. [/487]
[488]: Acquisition and restructuring related costs (or income) [/488]
[489]: The Company records costs or expenses incurred related to business combinations, organizational restructuring, or gains or losses attributable to any sales or dispositions of assets, including impairments, to acquisition and restructuring related expense, net. [/489]
[490]: Operating income [/490]
[491]: Operating income is gross profit less SG&A, RD&E, acquisition and restructuring related expense or income and amortization of intangible assets. Operating income excludes interest expense, income tax expense, and other non-operating expenses, net. We use operating income as well as other indicators as a measure of the profitability of our business. [/491]
[492]: 38 [/492]
[493]: Interest expense, net [/493]
[494]: The Company incurs interest expense on its Credit Facilities, as defined herein. The amortization of debt issuance costs and impact of our interest rate hedging instruments are also included in interest expense. [/494]
[475]: Net sales [/475]
[476]: We offer a broad range of pool equipment including pumps, filters, heaters, automatic cleaners, sanitizers, controls, LED lights, as well as industrial thermoplastic valves and process liquid control products. Sales are impacted by product and geographic segment mix, as well as promotional and competitive activities. Growth of our sales is primarily driven by market demand, expansion of our trade customers and product offering. [/476]
[477]: Revenue is recognized upon shipment and recorded net of related discounts, allowances, returns, and sales tax. Customers are offered volume discounts and other promotional benefits. We estimate these volume discounts, promotional allowance benefits, and returns based upon the terms of the customer contracts and historical experience and record such amounts as a reduction of gross sales with an offsetting adjustment to account receivable. We regularly monitor the adequacy of these allowances. [/477]
[478]: Gross profit and gross profit margin [/478]
[479]: Gross profit is equal to net sales less cost of sales. Cost of sales includes the direct cost of manufacturing, including direct materials, labor and related overhead, as well as inbound and outbound freight and import duties. [/479]
[117]: Segments [/117]
[118]: We operate in a global pool equipment market with an installed base that we estimate to be approximately 25 million pools globally. North America and Europe are the two largest pool markets, accounting for an estimated 68% of the total global installed base and 84% of total equipment sales according to market studies. [/118]
[119]: Our business is organized into two reportable segments: North America (“NAM”) and Europe & Rest of World (“E&RW”). We determined our operating segments based on how the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) reviews the Company’s operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. NAM and E&RW accounted for approximately 83% and 17% and 84% and 16% of total net sales for Fiscal Year 2023 and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 (“Fiscal Year 2022”), respectively. For financial information with respect to our business segments, see Item 7 . “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and Note 12 . “Segments and Related Information” of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in [/119]
[571]: Table element - Text before table: Adjusted segment income margin decreased to 28.9% in Fiscal Year 2023 from 30.7% in Fiscal Year 2022, a decrease of 180 basis points.

[542]: Segment Results of Operations [/542]
[543]: The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of NAM and E&RW. [/543]
[544]: We evaluate performance based on net sales, gross profit, segment income and adjusted segment income, and use gross profit margin, segment income margin and adjusted segment income margin as comparable performance measures for our reporting segments. [/544]
[545]: Segment income represents net sales less cost of sales, less segment SG&A and RD&E, excluding acquisition and restructuring related expense as well as amortization of intangible assets. A reconciliation of segment income to our operating income is detailed below. Adjusted segment income represents segment income adjusted for the impact of depreciation, amortization of certain intangible assets, stock-based compensation and certain non-cash, nonrecurring or other items that are included in segment income that we do not consider indicative of the ongoing segment operating performance. See “— Non-GAAP Reconciliation” for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures: [/545]
[650]: Critical Accounting Estimates [/650]
[651]: Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. [/651]
[652]: Our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe that the following critical accounting estimates include the most significant estimates and management judgments used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. [/652]
[751]: For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a $ 3.9 million impairment charge in its North America reportable segment for significant long-lived assets associated with the discontinuation of a product line. The charge is recorded within acquisition and restructuring related expense in the consolidated statements of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a $ 5.5 million impairment charge in its North America reportable segment for significant long-lived assets associated with the discontinuation of a product joint development agreement. The charge is recorded within selling, general and administrative expense within the consolidated statements of operations. [/751]
[752]: Goodwill and Intangible Assets The purchase price in excess of net assets of businesses acquired is classified as goodwill in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company tests goodwill at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment that constitutes a business for which financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”). The Company determined that it has 5 reporting units for this purpose. The Company tests for impairment at least annually or if there is an indication that goodwill may be impaired. The Company has the option to first complete a qualitative assessment (i.e., “Step 0”) to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the business is less than its carrying amount. If the Company determines that this is the case, it is required to perform the currently prescribed quantitative impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be charged for that reporting [/752]
[890]: Table element - Text before table: The Company’s operating and finance lease portfolio primarily consists of office space, IT equipment, office equipment, and vehicles. Operating lease ROU assets are presented within other non-current assets. The current portion of operating lease liabilities are presented within accrued expenses and other liabilities, and the non-current portion of operating lease liabilities are presented within other non-current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Finance lease assets are included in property, plant and equipment - net, and the finance lease obligations are included in current portion of long-term debt and in long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets.
The Company has elected to use the short-term lease recognition exemption for all asset classes. This means, for those leases that qualify, the Company will not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities, and this includes not recognizing ROU assets or lease liabilities for existing short-term leases of those assets. For these short-term leases, expense will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases. The Company has also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for all asset classes, meaning all consideration that is fixed, or in-substance fixed, will be captured as part of its lease components for balance sheet purposes.

[1258]: Segment Reporting We operate in a single segment, which is to provide capital return to stockholders by maximizing the potential value of our portfolio of royalties and innovative healthcare assets. Our Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) is our Chief Executive Officer. The CODM allocates resources and evaluates the performance of Innoviva at the consolidated level using information about our revenues, operating results and other key financial data as needed. Our revenues are generated primarily from our collaborative arrangements and royalty payments from GSK, located in Great Britain. We also generate revenue from net product sales of GIAPREZA ® , XERAVA ® , and XACDURO ® . Refer to Note 3, “Revenue Recognition”, for more information on our revenues for the periods presented. Our long-term assets are located within the United States. [/1258]

[1260]: Variable Interest Entities The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (“VIE”) is required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the VIE. When we obtain a variable interest in another entity, we assess at the inception of the relationship and upon occurrence of certain significant events whether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE based on our power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and our obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. To assess whether we have the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, we consider all the facts and circumstances, including our role in establishing the VIE and our ongoing rights and responsibilities. This assessment includes identifying the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and identifying which party, if any, has power over those activities. In general, the parties that make the most significant decisions affecting the VIE (management and representation on the Board of Directors) and have the right to unilaterally remove those decision-makers are deemed to have the power to direct the activities of a VIE. To assess whether we have the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE, we consider all of our economic interests that are deemed to be variable interests in the VIE. This assessment requires us to apply judgment in determining whether these interests, in the aggregate, are considered potentially significant to the VIE. [/1260]

[1020]: Financial Highlights [/1020]
[1021]: • Royalty revenue: Fourth quarter 2023 gross royalty revenue from GSK was $69.6 million and full year was $252.7 million, compared to $54.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2022 and $253.4 million for the full year 2022. [/1021]
[1022]: 78 [/1022]
[1023]: Table of Contents [/1023]
[1024]: • Net Product Sales: Fourth quarter 2023 net product sales and license revenue were $19.7 million, which included $13.1 million from GIAPREZA ® , $5.2 million from XERAVA ® , and $1.4 million from XACDURO ® , compared to $14.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2022.

[/1024]
[1025]: • Equity and long-term investments: Fourth quarter and full year 2023 change in fair values of equity and long-term investments of $25.5 million and $88.5 million, respectively, was primarily attributable to Armata share price appreciation. [/1025]
[1102]: Total royalty revenue, net, decreased to $311.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in total net royalty revenue was primarily due to the sale of our ownership interest in TRC, which received royalties stemming from sales of TRELEGY ® ELLIPTA ® . Royalties for RELVAR ® /BREO ® ELLIPTA ® and ANORO ® ELLIPTA ® decreased due to pricing pressures in the U.S. market and foreign currency rate changes. [/1102]
[1103]: Net Product Sales [/1103]
[1104]: Net product sales for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $60.6 million, consisting of net sales of GIAPREZA ® , XERAVA ® and XACDURO ® for $41.3 million, $17.3 million, and $2.0 million, respectively.

[507]: See the section titled “—Critical Accounting Estimates—Revenue Recognition” for a description of the accounting policies related to revenue recognition, including arrangements that contain multiple deliverables. [/507]
[508]: Cost of revenue [/508]
[509]: Cost of revenue includes all costs of providing and fulfilling our services. Cost of revenue primarily includes government filing fees, costs of fulfillment, customer care, including the cost of credentialed professionals for tax, and payroll services, and related benefits, including stock-based compensation, and costs of independent contractors for document preparation, telecommunications and data center costs, amortization of acquired developed technology, depreciation and amortization of network computers, equipment and internal-use software, printing, shipping and handling charges, credit and debit card fees, allocated overhead, legal document kit expenses, and sales and use taxes. We defer direct and incremental costs primarily related to government filing fees incurred prior to the associated service meeting the criteria for revenue recognition. These contract assets are recognized as cost of revenue in the same period the related revenue is recognized. [/509]
[789]: Revenue Recognition [/789]
[790]: As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s total consolidated revenue was $660.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company recognizes revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the promised good or service to the customer. For transaction-based services, revenue is generally recognized at a point-in-time when the services are delivered to the customer. For subscription-based services, revenue is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the subscription term. Revenue earned from leads generated to third-party providers is recognized at a point-in-time when the related performance-based criteria have been met. Services can generally either be purchased on a stand-alone basis or bundled together as part of a package of services. Accordingly, a significant number of the Company’s arrangements include multiple performance obligations. The transaction price is based on the contractual amounts and is allocated to each separate performance obligation based on the amount of consideration which management expects to be entitled in exchange for the services provided.

[515]: Operating expenses [/515]
[516]: Our operating expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing, technology and development, general and administrative expenses, and to a lesser extent, impairments of goodwill, long-lived assets and other assets. [/516]
[517]: Sales and marketing [/517]
[518]: Sales and marketing expenses consist of customer acquisition media costs, compensation and related benefits, including stock-based compensation for marketing and sales personnel, media production, public relations and other promotional activities, general business development activities, an allocation of depreciation and amortization and allocated overhead. Customer acquisition media costs consist primarily of search engine marketing, television and social media costs. Marketing and advertising costs to promote our services are expensed in the period incurred. Media production costs are expensed the first time the advertisement is aired. [/518]
[519]: We intend to continue to invest in sales and marketing to drive additional revenue, further penetrate our expanding addressable market, and build on our digital brand leadership and awareness. We anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will continue to be our largest operating expense category for the foreseeable future. [/519]
[840]: 65 [/840]
[841]: Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, however not limited to, revenue recognition, sales allowances and expected credit loss allowances, available-for-sale debt securities, other equity securities, recoverability of long-lived assets and goodwill, income taxes, commitments and contingencies, valuation of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations, valuation of assets in asset acquisitions, fair value of derivative instruments and stock-based compensation. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the estimates compared to historical experience and other factors including the current economic and regulatory environment, which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities. Business Combinations The results of businesses acquired in a business combination are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. Purchase accounting results in assets and liabilities of an acquired business being recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Any excess purchase consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. We perform valuations of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for an acquisition and allocate the purchase price to their respective net tangible and intangible assets. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use judgment and estimates, including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of cash flows, discount rates and selection of comparable companies. We generally engage the assistance of a third-party valuation firm in determining fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and contingent consideration, if any, in a business combination. Transaction costs associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred and are included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Asset Acquisitions We evaluate acquisitions to determine whether the acquisition should be classified as either a business combination or an asset acquisition. Acquisitions for which substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired are concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets are accounted for as an asset acquisition. If the gross assets are not concentrated in a single asset or group of similar assets, we then determine if the set of assets acquired represents a business. A business is an integrated set of activities and assets capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return. Depending on the nature of the acquisition, judgment may be required to determine if the set of assets acquired is a business combination or not. We allocate the purchase price on a relative fair value basis and capitalize direct acquisition related costs as part of the purchase price. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating the purchase price, we utilize an independent third-party to value the net tangible and identified intangible assets in connection with the acquisition. Segment and Geographic Information Our Chief Executive Officer, as the Chief Operating Decision Maker organizes our company, manages resource allocations, and measures performance on the basis of one operating segment. Revenue outside of the U.S., based on the location of the customer, represented less than 1 % of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. Our property and equipment and right-of-use, or ROU, assets located outside of the U.S. were immaterial as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Foreign Currency The British Pound Sterling is the functional currency for our foreign subsidiaries domiciled in the U.K. The financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. Dollars using period-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, historical rates of exchange for equity, and average rates of exchange for the period for revenue and expenses. Translation gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income as a component of our consolidated statements of redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders’ equity. We recognized foreign currency transaction gain in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations of $ 1.4 million for 2023 and losses of $ 3.6 million and $ 0.9 million for 2022 and  2021, respectively. Fair Value Measurements Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The standard establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs [/841]

[585]: Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 [/585]
[586]: Revenue [/586]
[588]: (1)     Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023, we no longer present partner revenue on a standalone basis and partner revenue is now included within transaction and subscription revenue. This change had no impact on total revenue. Prior period disclosures and amounts have been conformed to the current period presentation. [/588]
[589]: The increase in total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 was driven by an increase in subscription revenue. Subscription revenue was 62% and 58% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and transaction revenue was 38% and 42% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. [/589]
[590]: Transaction revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased due to a 15% decrease in average order value compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, partially offset by a 12% increase in the number of transaction units over the same period. The decrease in average order value for the year ended December 31, 2023 was driven primarily by a 25% decrease in average order value related to our business formations due to the nationwide rollout of free LLC formations during the first quarter of 2023. The overall increase in transaction units during the year ended December 31, 2023 was due to a 23% increase in business formations due primarily to the nationwide rollout of free LLC formations. This increase was partially offset by a 12% reduction in estate planning transactions. [/590]
[596]: Gross profit [/596]
[598]: The increase in gross profit was driven by a $40.7 million increase in revenue partially offset by a $28.2 million increase in cost of revenue as discussed above. [/598]
[599]: Sales and marketing [/599]
[601]: Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased primarily due to a $29.3 million reduction in customer acquisition media spend, an $18.1 million reduction in payroll and related benefits, a $5.8 million reduction in media production spend, a $4.0 million reduction in stock-based compensation expense, and a $1.7 million reduction in depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by a $9.0 million increase in consulting fees. The decrease in stock-based compensation expense and payroll and related benefits was largely due to decreased sales and marketing headcount. Customer acquisition media spend was $145.3 million and $174.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, as we reduced our marketing spend in 2023 to align with our freemium strategy.

[872]: amortization of acquired developed technology, depreciation and amortization of network computers, equipment and internal-use software, printing, shipping and handling charges, credit and debit card fees, allocated overhead, legal document kit expenses, and sales and use taxes. We defer direct and incremental costs primarily related to government filing fees incurred prior to the associated service meeting the criteria for revenue recognition. These contract assets are recognized as cost of revenue in the same period the related revenue is recognized. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, there was $ 1.7 million and $ 1.9 million, respectively, in deferred cost of revenue included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Filing fees of $ 88.1 million, $ 74.1 million and $ 79.8 million were recorded in cost of revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Sales and Marketing Expenses Sales and marketing expenses consist of customer acquisition media costs, compensation and related benefits, including stock-based compensation for marketing and sales personnel, media production, public relations and other promotional activities, general business development activities, an allocation of depreciation and amortization and allocated overhead. Customer acquisition media costs consist primarily of search engine marketing, television and social media costs. Marketing and advertising costs to promote our services are expensed in the period incurred. Media production costs are expensed the first time the advertisement is aired. Advertising expenses, consisting of customer acquisition media costs, were $ 145.3 million, $ 174.6 million and $ 195.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Technology and Development Expenses Technology and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and related benefits, including stock-based compensation, expenses for outside consultants, an allocation of depreciation and amortization and allocated overhead. These expenses include costs incurred in the development and implementation of our products, websites, mobile applications, online legal platform, research and development and related infrastructure. Technology and development expenses are expensed as incurred, except to the extent that such costs are associated with internal-use software costs that qualify for capitalization as previously described under Internal-use Software and Cloud Computing Arrangements . General and Administrative Expenses Our general and administrative expenses relate primarily to compensation and related benefits, including stock-based compensation, for executive and corporate personnel, professional and consulting fees, an allocation of depreciation and amortization, allocated overhead and legal costs. Stock-based Compensation We estimate the fair value of employee stock-based payment awards on the grant-date and recognize the resulting fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model for estimating the fair value of options granted under our stock option plans that vest based on service and performance conditions. The fair value of restricted stock units, or RSUs, that vest based on service and performance conditions is determined based on the value of the underlying common stock at the date of grant. For awards that contain market conditions, we estimate the fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation model. We record expense for awards that contain performance conditions only to the extent that we determine it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. Expense for awards containing market conditions is not reversed even if the market condition is not achieved. We have elected to treat stock-based payment awards with graded vesting schedules and time-based service conditions as a single award and recognize stock-based compensation on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period. Awards with performance or market conditions are recognized using graded vesting. The Black-Scholes option pricing model and the Monte Carlo simulation model requires us to make certain assumptions including the fair value of the underlying common stock, the expected term, the expected volatility, the risk-free interest rate and the dividend yield. The fair value of the shares of common stock underlying stock options and RSUs is based upon our publicly listed share price on the date of grant. Prior to our IPO, the fair value of the shares of common stock was determined by the board of directors. Because there was no public market for our common stock, the board of directors determined the fair value of the common stock at the time of the grant of options and RSUs by considering a number of objective and subjective factors including valuation of comparable companies, sales of common stock to unrelated third-parties, operating and financial performance and general and industry-specific economic outlook, amongst other factors. The fair value was determined in accordance [/872]

[369]: Table element - Text before table: ​; table: (row 0) 
 (col 0): (2) (col 1): Gross profit, calculated as net sales less cost of sales, and gross profit margin, calculated as gross profit divided by net sales, are non-GAAP financial measures as they exclude depreciation and amortization expense associated with the corresponding sales. About half of our orders are basic distribution with no processing services performed. For the remainder of our sales orders, we perform “first-stage” processing, which is generally not labor intensive as we are simply cutting the metal to size. Because of this, the amount of related labor and overhead, including depreciation and amortization, is not significant and is excluded from cost of sales. Therefore, our cost of sales is substantially comprised of the cost of the material we sell. We use gross profit and gross profit margin as shown above as measures of operating performance. Gross profit and gross profit margin are important operating and financial measures as their fluctuations can have a significant impact on our earnings. Gross profit and gross profit margin, as presented, are not necessarily comparable with similarly titled measures for other companies. (row end);

[527]: 1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies [/527]
[528]: Nature of Operations Stepan Company’s (the Company) operations consist predominantly of the production and sale of specialty and intermediate chemicals, which are sold to other manufacturers for use in a variety of end products.  Principal markets for all products are manufacturers of cleaning and washing compounds (including detergents, shampoos, fabric softeners, toothpastes and household cleaners), paints, cosmetics, food, beverages, nutritional supplements, agricultural products, plastics, furniture, automotive equipment, insulation and refrigeration. [/528]
[529]: Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires Company management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses at the date of the financial statements and to provide disclosures of contingent assets, liabilities and related amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. [/529]

[434]: The following statements and data are included in this item: [/434]
[436]: Report of Independent Regist ered Public Accounting Firm [/436]
[437]: To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Stepan Company [/437]
[438]: Opinion on the Financial Statements [/438]
[439]: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Stepan Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flow, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. [/439]
[544]: Revenue Recognition The Company’s contracts typically have a single performance obligation that is satisfied at the time product is shipped and control passes to the customer.  For a small portion of the business, performance obligations are deemed satisfied when product is delivered to a customer location.  For arrangements where the Company consigns product to a customer location, revenue is recognized when the customer uses the inventory.  The Company accounts for shipping and handling as activities to fulfill a promise to transfer a good.  As such, shipping and handling fees billed to customers in a sales transaction are recorded in Net Sales and shipping and handling costs incurred are recorded in Cost of Sales.  Volume and cash discounts due customers are estimated and recorded in the same period as the sales to which the discounts relate and are reported as reductions of revenue in the consolidated statements of income.  See Note 21, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , of the notes to the Company’s consolidated financial statements (included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for more details. [/544]
[407]: When estimating a reporting unit’s fair value as part of the quantitative assessment, the Company uses a combination of market and income-based methodologies.  The market approach uses a combination of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and EBITDA multiples to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value.  EBITDA multiples typically mirror similar businesses or comparative companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets. Significant degradation of either EBITDA or EBITDA multiples could result in a triggering event, requiring goodwill to be tested for impairment during an interim period.  The income approach takes into consideration multiple variables, including forecasted sales volume and operating income, current industry and economic conditions, historical results and other elements to calculate the present value of future cash flows.  The income approach fair value calculations include estimates of long-term growth rates and discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units.  The Company reported goodwill and other intangible assets impairment expenses during 2023 and goodwill impairment expenses during 2022.  See Note 4, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , of the notes to the Company’s consolidated financial statements (included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for additional information. [/407]
[415]: Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income and Dilutive Earnings per Share [/415]
[416]: Management uses the non-GAAP adjusted net income metric to evaluate the Company’s operating performance.  Management excludes the items listed in the table below because they are non-operational items.  The cumulative tax effect was calculated using the statutory tax rates for the jurisdictions in which the transactions occurred. [/416]

[419]: Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Net Debt [/419]
[420]: Management uses the non-GAAP net debt metric to show a more complete picture of the Company’s overall liquidity, financial flexibility and leverage level. [/420]

[423]: It em 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk [/423]
[424]: Foreign Currency Exchange Risk [/424]
[425]: Because the Company operates globally, its cash flows and operating results are subject to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Except for the financial transactions, balances and forward contracts referred to below, most of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries’ financial instruments are denominated in their respective functional currencies. [/425]

[334]: Gross profit for Asia and Other operations increased $0.2 million, or five percent, primarily due to a 16 percent increase in sales volume, which positively impacted the year-over-year change in gross profit by $0.7 million.  Lower average unit margins and the unfavorable impact of the foreign currency translation negatively impacted the year-over-year change in gross profit by $0.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively. [/334]
[335]: Operating expenses for the Polymers segment decreased $3.8 million, or 12 percent, year-over-year mainly due to lower salaries and incentive-based compensation expenses. [/335]
[336]: Specialty Products [/336]
[337]: Specialty Products net sales in 2023 decreased $21.0 million, or 21 percent, versus net sales in 2022. Gross profit and operating income decreased $19.3 million and $18.4 million, respectively, year-over-year.  The year-over-year decline in net sales, gross profit and operating income were mostly attributable to a 19 percent decline in sales volume and lower unit margins within the medium chain triglycerides (MCT) product line. The lower unit margins were primarily due to high-cost raw material inventory and competitive pressures. [/337]

[554]: Segment Reporting The Company reports financial and descriptive information about its reportable operating segments.  Operating segments are components of the Company that have separate financial information that is regularly evaluated by the chief operating decision maker to assess segment performance and allocate resources.  The Company discloses segment revenue, operating income, assets, capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization expenses.  Enterprise-wide financial information about the geographic locations in which the Company earns revenues and holds assets is also disclosed.  See Note 17, Segment Reporting , of the notes to the Company’s consolidated financial statements (included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for detailed information about the Company’s segment reporting. [/554]
[555]: Derivative Instruments Derivative instruments are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value.  For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments, changes in the fair values of the derivative instruments are recognized currently in earnings.  For derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair values of the derivative instruments are either offset in earnings against changes in the fair values of the hedged items 53 or recognized in AOCI until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings.  At the time a hedging relationship is designated, the Company establishes the method it will use for assessing the effectiveness of the hedge and the measurement approach for determining the ineffective aspect of the hedge.  Company policy prohibits the use of derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.  See Note 3, Derivative Instruments , of the notes to the Company’s consolidated financial statements (included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further information regarding the Company’s use of derivatives. At December 31, 2023 , the Company held open forward contracts for the purchase of 0.7 million dekatherms of natural gas in 2024 at a cost of $ 3,403,000 .  The Company uses forward contracts to minimize its exposure to volatile natural gas prices.  Because the Company anticipates taking delivery of the natural gas for use in its operations, the forward contracts qualify for the normal purchase exception provided under U.S. GAAP for derivative instruments.  The Company has elected the exception for such contracts.  As a result, the forward contracts are not accounted for as derivative instruments.  The cost of natural gas is charged to expense at the time the natural gas is delivered and used. [/555]
[550]: Translation of Foreign Currencies For the Company’s consolidated foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the local foreign currency, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at year end and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the year.  Any resulting translation adjustments are included within the consolidated balance sheets on the accumulated other comprehensive loss line of stockholders’ equity.  Gains or losses on foreign currency transactions are reflected in the other, net line of the consolidated statements of income.  The Company has four foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the U.S. dollar.  For these subsidiaries, nonmonetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical rates, monetary assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at year end, revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the year and translation gains and losses are included in the other, net caption of the consolidated statements of income. [/550]

[400]: Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies [/400]
[401]: The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP).  Preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses at the date of the financial statements and to provide disclosures of contingent assets, liabilities and related amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  The following is a summary of the accounting policies the Company believes are the most important to aid in understanding its financial results: [/401]
[330]: Table element - Text before table: Net sales for European Polymer operations decreased $48.0 million, or 16 percent, year-over-year.  A 10 percent decrease in sales volume and lower average selling prices negatively impacted the change in net sales by $32.1 million and $24.7 million, respectively.  The decline in sales volume reflects customer and channel inventory destocking, reduced construction-related activities and customer share loss.  The lower average selling prices were primarily due to the pass-through of lower raw material costs and increased competitive activities.  Favorable foreign currency translation positively impacted the change in net sales by $8.8 million.  A weaker U.S. dollar relative to the Polish zloty led to the favorable foreign currency translation.
Net sales for Asian and Other operations decreased $0.3 million, or one percent.  Lower average selling prices and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation negatively impacted the year-over-year change in net sales by $5.2 million and $2.2 million, respectively.  A 16 percent increase in sales volume positively impacted the change in net sales by $7.1 million.  The higher sales volume reflects the loosening of COVID lockdowns and restrictions in China during the early part of 2023.
Polymer operating income for 2023 decreased $22.1 million, or 27 percent, versus operating income for 2022.  Gross profit decreased $25.9 million, or 23 percent, and operating expenses were down $3.8 million, or 12 percent, year-over-year.

[789]: (1) Options/SARs to purchase 672,485 , 343,715 and 103,182 shares of the Company’s common stock were excluded from the computations of diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 , respectively.  The options’/SARs’ exercise prices were greater than the average market price for the Company’s common stock and inclusion of the instruments would have had an antidilutive effect on the computations of earnings per share.

[315]: Surfactant operating income for 2023 decreased $90.3 million, or 56 percent, versus operating income reported in 2022.  Gross profit decreased $105.4 million, or 38 percent, and operating expenses decreased $15.1 million, or 13 percent.  Year-over-year comparisons of gross profit by region and total segment operating expenses and operating income follow: [/315]
[317]: Gross profit for North American operations decreased $61.9 million, or 36 percent, primarily due to lower average unit margins and a 14 percent decrease in sales volume.  These items negatively impacted the year-over-year change in gross profit by $37.9 million and $23.9 million, respectively.  The lower average unit margins were mostly attributable to less favorable product mix and high-cost inventory carryover in 2023.  Foreign currency translation negatively impacted the change in gross profit by $0.1 million. [/317]
[318]: Gross profit for European operations decreased $14.7 million, or 36 percent, primarily due to lower average unit margins and an 11 percent decrease in sales volume.  These items negatively impacted the year-over-year change in gross profit by $10.6 million and $4.4 million, respectively.  The lower average unit margins primarily reflect a less favorable product mix and increased competitive activity within certain end-use markets.  Foreign currency translation positively impacted the year-over-year change in gross profit by $0.3 million. [/318]

Effects of Foreign Currency Translation
The Company’s foreign subsidiaries transact business and report financial results in their respective local currencies.  As a result, foreign subsidiary income statements are translated into U.S. dollars at average foreign exchange rates appropriate for the reporting period.  Because foreign exchange rates fluctuate against the U.S. dollar over time, foreign currency translation affects year-over-year comparisons of financial statement items (i.e., because foreign exchange rates fluctuate, similar year-over-year local currency results for a foreign subsidiary may translate into different U.S. dollar results).  The following tables present the effects that foreign currency translation had on the year-over-year changes in consolidated net sales and various income statement line items for 2023 compared to 2022 and 2022 compared to 2021:; table: (row 0)

[769]: The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. In addition, when we acquire businesses, we make judgments about how best to account for their revenue, assets and liabilities in our condensed consolidated financial statements. These judgments may be based on limited information, estimates and various assumptions, which we may revisit as we more fully integrate such businesses into our company. Critical accounting policies and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to: revenue recognition; write-down of supplies; the useful lives of property, plant and equipment; the recoverability of long-lived assets; the incremental borrowing rate for leases; the estimation of the fair value of intangible assets and contingent consideration; variable interest entity assessment; impairment of equity investment, at cost; stock options; income tax uncertainties, including a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets; reserve on accounts receivable and contingencies. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the price of our common stock. [/769]
[1134]: 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies [/1134]
[1135]: Basis of Presentation The Company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Reclassifications Certain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Such reclassifications have no effect on previously reported results of operations, accumulated deficit, subtotals of operating, investing or financing cash flows or consolidated balance sheet totals; however, for the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company reclassified $ 3.3 million of impairment of long-lived assets from the general and administrative expense caption in the consolidated statements of operations. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates include: revenue recognition; the useful lives of property, plant and equipment; the recoverability of long-lived assets; the incremental borrowing rates for leases; accounting for acquisitions; the estimation of the fair value of intangible assets and contingent consideration; stock based compensation; income tax uncertainties, including a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets; credit related losses on investments; and allowance for credit losses and contingencies. The Company bases these estimates on historical and anticipated results, trends, and various other assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. These estimates [/1135]
[903]: Product Revenue [/903]
[904]: Our products consist of the Prosigna breast cancer assay, the nCounter Analysis System, related diagnostic kits, and services. We recognize product revenue when control of the promised goods is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those products. This process involves identifying the contract with a customer, determining the performance obligations in the contract, determining the contract price, allocating the contract price to the distinct performance obligations in the contract, and recognizing revenue when the performance obligations have been satisfied. A performance obligation is considered distinct from other obligations in a contract when it provides a benefit to the customer, either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer, and is separately identified in the contract. Performance obligations are considered satisfied once we have transferred control of a product to the customer, meaning the customer has the ability to use and obtain the benefit of the product. We recognize product revenue for satisfied performance obligations only when there are no uncertainties regarding payment terms or transfer of control. Shipping and handling costs incurred for product shipments are charged to our customers and included in product revenue. Revenue is presented net of the taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities. [/904]
[923]: Cost of Product Revenue [/923]
[924]: Our cost of product revenue consists primarily of costs of purchasing instruments and diagnostic kits from third-party contract manufacturers, installation, warranty, service and packaging and delivery costs. In addition, cost of product revenue includes royalty costs for licensed technologies included in our products and labor expenses. As our Prosigna test kits are sold in various configurations with different number of tests, our product cost per test will vary based on the specific kit configuration purchased by customers. [/924]
[925]: Cost of Biopharmaceutical and Other Revenue [/925]
[926]: Our cost of biopharmaceutical and other revenue are the costs of performing activities under arrangements that require us to perform research and development, commercialization, contract manufacturing and development, and previously included contract testing services on behalf of a customer. This cost is mainly composed of compensation expense, manufacturing and laboratory supplies and pass-through costs. [/926]

[943]: Product Revenue [/943]
[944]: Our products consist of the Prosigna breast cancer assay, the nCounter Analysis System, related diagnostic kits, and services.

Revenues are presented net of the taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities. [/944]
[945]: Biopharmaceutical and Other Revenues [/945]
[946]: For biopharmaceutical and other revenue, we develop estimates and assumptions that require judgment to determine the underlying stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation which determines how the transaction price is allocated among the performance obligations. The estimation of the stand-alone selling price may include independent evidence of [/946]
[947]: 70 [/947]
[948]: Table of Contents [/948]
[949]: market price, forecasted revenues or costs, development timelines, discount rates, and probabilities of technical and regulatory success. We evaluate each performance obligation to determine if they can be satisfied at a point in time or over time, and we measure the services delivered to the collaborative partner which are periodically reviewed based on the progress of the related program. For licenses that are bundled with other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time. The effect of any change made to an estimated input component and, therefore revenue or expense recognized, would be recorded as a change in estimate. In addition, variable consideration must be evaluated to determine if it is constrained and, therefore, excluded from the transaction price. [/949]
[978]: Comparison of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is included in Item 8 of Part II of the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission dated March 1, 2023. [/978]

[980]: Table of Contents [/980]
[981]: Cost of revenue [/981]
[982]: Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was as follows (in thousands of dollars, except percentages): [/982]
[984]: Cost of testing revenue increased $13.6 million, or 18.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022. The increase in cost of testing revenue is due to increased volume in testing, primarily related to Afirma and Decipher Prostate. [/984]
[985]: Cost of product revenue is related to sales of Prosigna and nCounter Analysis Systems. Cost of product revenue increased $0.8 million, or 11%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, driven by increased product test volume. [/985]
[986]: Cost of biopharmaceutical and other revenue includes labor costs incurred by our employees working on customer projects and laboratory supplies and pass-through expenses incurred on these projects. Cost of biopharmaceutical and other revenue decreased by $3.1 million driven by reductions of variable expenses related to projects. [/986]
[905]: Biopharmaceutical and Other Revenue [/905]
[906]: We enter into arrangements to license or provide access to our assets or services, including clinical services, research and development, contract manufacturing and development, as well as other services. Such arrangements may require us to deliver various rights, data, services, manufactured diagnostic test kits, access and/or testing services to partner biopharmaceutical and other companies. The underlying terms of these arrangements generally provide for consideration paid to us in the form of nonrefundable fees; payments on delivery of data, test results or manufactured products; costs of service plus margin; performance milestone payments; expense reimbursements and possibly royalty and/or other payments.  Net sales of data or other services to our customers are recognized in accordance with ASC 606 and are classified under biopharmaceutical and other revenue. Payments received that are not related to sales or services to a customer are recorded as offsets against research and development expense or cost of biopharmaceutical and other revenue in our consolidated statements of operations. [/906]
[1142]: The Company is also subject to credit risk from its accounts receivable related to its sales. Credit risk for accounts receivable from testing revenue is incorporated in testing revenue accrual rates as the Company assesses historical collection rates and current developments to determine accrual rates and amounts the Company will ultimately collect. The Company generally does not perform evaluations of customers’ financial condition for testing revenue and generally does not require collateral. The Company assesses credit risk and the amount of accounts receivable the Company will ultimately collect for product, biopharmaceutical and other revenue based on collection history, current developments and credit worthiness of the customer. The estimate of credit losses is not material at December 31, 2023. [/1142]
[1143]: The Company's total third-party payers and other customers in excess of 10% of total revenue and their related revenue as a percentage of total revenue were as follows: [/1143]

[1139]: Liquidity [/1139]
[1140]: The Company has incurred net losses since its inception and as of December 31, 2023, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $ 468.1 million.  The Company believes its cash and cash equivalents of $ 216.5 million as of December 31, 2023, and its revenue from sales in 2024 will be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash requirements through at least February 2025. [/1140]
[1141]: Concentrations of Credit Risk and Other Risks and Uncertainties The majority of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents are deposited with two major financial institutions in the United States. Deposits in these institutions may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. The Company has not realized any losses on its deposits of cash and cash equivalents other than exchange rate losses related to foreign currency denominated accounts. Several of the components of the Company's sample collection kits and test reagents, and the nCounter Analysis system and related diagnostic kits, are obtained from single-source suppliers. If these single-source suppliers fail to satisfy the Company's requirements on a timely basis, or are unable to provide the Company with reagents that perform to specifications, the Company could suffer delays in being able to deliver its diagnostic solutions, suffer a possible loss of revenue, or incur higher costs, any of which could adversely affect its operating results. Through December 31, 2023, the Company has derived most of its revenue from the sale of Decipher and Afirma testing. To date, Decipher and Afirma testing have been delivered primarily to physicians in the United States. [/1141]
[929]: Selling and Marketing [/929]
[930]: Selling and marketing expenses consist of compensation expenses, direct marketing expenses, professional fees, other expenses such as travel and communications costs, as well as allocation of facility and information technology expenses. Our sales team of approximately 120 representatives is organized by business unit in the United States, with separate teams calling on thyroid cancer, urologic cancers, and pulmonology physicians. The business units have dedicated marketing support, as well as a marketing operations team that serves the commercial organization broadly. Prosigna sales outside of the United States are led by country managers that call on laboratories and breast cancer oncologists and have dedicated marketing support. [/930]
[931]: General and Administrative [/931]
[932]: General and administrative expenses include compensation expenses for executive officers and administrative, billing and client service personnel, professional fees for legal and audit services, occupancy costs, depreciation and amortization, and other expenses such as information technology and miscellaneous expenses, offset by allocation of facility and information technology expenses to other functions. General and administrative expenses include costs related to the acquisitions of Decipher Biosciences and HalioDx, which were included in general and administrative compensation expense and professional fees. We expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase as we build our infrastructure to scale revenue growth, and to decline as a percentage of revenue thereafter. [/932]

[750]: Gross Profit and Gross Margin [/750]
[751]: Gross profit consists of our net revenues less cost of goods sold. Gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of our net revenues. Our cost of goods sold primarily consists of the cost of raw materials including ingredients and packaging, co-manufacturing fees, direct and indirect labor and certain supply costs, inbound and internal shipping and handling costs incurred in manufacturing our products, warehouse storage fees, plant and equipment overhead, depreciation and amortization expense, provision for excess and obsolete inventory, and accelerated depreciation on write-offs and disposals of certain fixed assets. Under certain circumstances, our cost of goods sold may also include underutilization and/or termination fees associated with our co-manufacturing agreements. Gross profit and gross margin in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the prior-year periods were positively impacted by lower manufacturing costs including lower depreciation expense resulting from a change in the estimated useful lives of certain of our large manufacturing equipment. See Note 6 , Property, Plant and Equipment, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. [/751]
[1059]: Presentation of Net Revenues by Channel [/1059]
[1060]: The following table presents the Company’s net revenues by channel: [/1060]
[1062]: One distributor accounted for approximately 12 % of the Company’s gross revenues in each of 2023 and 2022; two distributors accounted for approximately 12 % and 11 % of the Company’s gross revenues in 2021. No other distributor or customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s gross revenues in 2023, 2022 or 2021. [/1062]

[1064]: BEYOND MEAT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES [/1064]
[1065]: Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) [/1065]
[1067]: Earnings (Loss) Per Share Earnings (loss) per share (“EPS”) represents net income available to common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS represents net income available to common stockholders divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, inclusive of the dilutive impact of potential common shares outstanding during the period. Such potential common shares include options, unvested restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and contracts classified as assets or liabilities that are required or assumed to be share-settled under the two-class method. The Company calculates basic and diluted EPS available to common stockholders in conformity with the two-class method required for companies with participating securities. Pursuant to ASU 2020-06, the Company applies the more dilutive of the if-converted method and the two-class method to its Notes. Computation of EPS for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 also excludes adjustments under the two-class method relating to a liability classified, share-settled obligation to an executive officer to deliver a variable number of shares based on a fixed monetary amount because the shares to be delivered are not participating securities as they do not have voting rights and are not entitled to participate in dividends until they are issued. In periods when the Company records net loss, all potential common shares are excluded in the computation of EPS because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. See Note 12 . Prepaid Expenses Prepaid expenses primarily include prepaid insurance and other prepaid vendor costs, which are expensed in the period to which they relate. Prepaid expenses are included under the caption “Prepaid assets and other assets” in consolidated balance sheets and were $ 8.3 million, and $ 14.5 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Investment in Joint Venture The Company uses the equity method of accounting to record transactions associated with its joint venture when the Company shares in joint control of the investee. Investment in joint venture is not consolidated but is recorded in “Investment in unconsolidated joint venture” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The Company recognizes its portion of the investee’s results in “Equity in losses of unconsolidated joint venture” in its consolidated statement of operations. The Company eliminates its proportionate interest in any intra-entity profits or losses in the inventory of the investee at the end of the reporting period and recognizes its portion of the profit and losses when realized by the investee. Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Expenses SG&A expenses are primarily comprised of selling, marketing expenses and administrative expenses, including personnel and related expenses, share-based compensation, outbound shipping and handling costs, non-manufacturing lease expense, depreciation and amortization expense on non-manufacturing and non-research and development assets, charges related to asset write-offs including loss on sale and write-down of fixed assets, consulting fees and other non-production operating expenses. Marketing and selling expenses include advertising costs, share-based compensation awards to brand ambassadors, costs associated with consumer promotions, product donations, product samples and sales aids incurred to acquire new customers, retain existing customers and build brand awareness. Administrative expenses include expenses related to management, accounting, legal, IT and other office functions. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $ 17.2 million, $ 20.6 million and $ 12.1 million, respectively. Non-advertising related components of the Company’s total marketing expenditures primarily include costs associated with consumer promotions, product sampling and sales aids, which are also included in SG&A. Shipping and Handling Costs [/1067]
[800]: Gross profit and gross margin in 2023 as compared to 2022 were negatively impacted by lower net revenues per pound, higher inventory provision per pound and higher manufacturing costs including depreciation, partially offset by lower logistics costs and lower materials costs per pound. The increase in inventory provision included $38.0 million in non-cash charges resulting from our Global Operations Review. In addition, gross profit and gross margin in 2023 included a $4.4 million in contract termination costs associated with a certain co-manufacturing agreement and $6.1 million in additional provision for inventory associated with a large QSR customer. In 2023, gross profit and gross margin benefited by $19.0 million and 23%, respectively, as a result of a change in the estimated useful lives of certain of our large manufacturing equipment, as compared to those same measures calculated using our previous estimated useful lives. See Note 6 , Property, Plant and Equipment , to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. [/800]
[769]: Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Expenses [/769]
[770]: SG&A expenses consist primarily of selling, marketing and administrative expenses, including personnel and related expenses, share-based compensation, outbound shipping and handling costs, non-manufacturing lease expense, depreciation and amortization expense on non-manufacturing and non-research and development assets, charges related to asset write-offs including loss on sale and write-down of fixed assets, consulting fees and other non-production operating expenses. Marketing and selling expenses include advertising costs, share-based compensation awards to brand ambassadors, costs associated with consumer promotions, product donations, product samples and sales aids incurred to acquire new customers, retain existing customers and build our brand awareness. Administrative expenses include expenses related to management, accounting, legal, IT and other office functions. We decreased SG&A expenses in 2023 and expect SG&A expenses in 2024 to decrease further from the levels in 2023, as we focus on reducing and optimizing operating expenses more broadly, including as part of the implementation of lean value streams across our beef, pork and poultry platforms. [/770]
[390]: This was accounted for as a change in accounting estimate and was made on a prospective basis effective January 1, 2023. If actual results differ from our judgments and assumptions, then it may have a material, adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows. This change in accounting estimate decreased depreciation expense for 2023 by $21.0 million, impacting cost of goods sold and research and development expenses by $19.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively, and decreased both basic and diluted net loss per share available to common stockholders by $0.33. [/390]
[391]: Any changes in estimates, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP or any future impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and operating results. [/391]
[392]: The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP involves making estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets (including intangible assets), liabilities, revenues and expenses. This includes estimates, judgments and assumptions for assessing the recoverability of our assets, pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board issued authoritative guidance. If any estimates, judgments or assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record additional expenses and/or impairment charges. See “— The Company is subject to accounting estimate risks .” [/392]
[795]: Cost of goods sold in 2023 included $66.9 million in costs resulting from our Global Operations Review including incremental provision for excess and obsolete inventory, accelerated depreciation on planned write-offs or disposals of fixed assets, and write-off of prepaid raw materials cost. In addition, cost of goods sold in [/795]
[796]: 2023 included contract termination costs associated with certain co-manufacturing agreements in the amount of $4.4 million and additional specific provision, primarily for inventory associated with a large QSR customer in the amount of $6.1 million. Cost of goods sold in 2022 included contract termination and underutilization fees associated with a certain co-manufacturing agreement in the amounts of $4.1 million and $5.0 million, respectively. [/796]
[797]: Gross (Loss) Profit and Gross Margin [/797]
[799]: Gross profit in 2023 was a loss of $82.7 million, as compared to a loss of $23.7 million, in the prior year, a decline of $58.9 million or 248.1%. Gross margin in 2023 decreased to a negative gross margin of 24.1% from a negative gross margin of 5.7% in the prior year. Gross profit and gross margin decreased primarily due to a 10.8% decrease in net revenue per pound, a 8.1% decrease in total volume of products sold, and a 4.8% increase in cost per pound in 2023 compared to the prior year. [/799]
[774]: Restructuring Expenses [/774]
[775]: In May 2017, management approved a plan to terminate an exclusive supply agreement with one of our co-manufacturers. On October 18, 2022, the parties entered into a confidential written settlement agreement and mutual release in connection with this matter. See Note 3 , Restructuring , and Note 10 , Commitments and Contingencies , to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. [/775]
[776]: Results of Operations [/776]
[777]: The following table sets forth selected items in our consolidated statements of operations for the respective periods presented: [/777]
[779]: The following table presents selected items in our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net revenues for the respective periods presented: [/779]
[781]: Year Ended December 31, 2023 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2022 [/781]
[782]: Net Revenues [/782]
[784]: Net revenues in 2023 decreased $75.6 million, or 18.0%, as compared to the prior year driven by a 10.8% decrease in net revenue per pound and an 8.1% decrease in volume of products sold. The decrease in net revenue per pound was primarily driven by changes in product sales mix and increased trade discounts, partially offset by pricing changes and favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The decrease in volume of products sold primarily reflected weak category demand and the cycling of significant sell-in of Beyond Meat Jerky to TPP in 2022. Net revenues from sales of Beyond Meat Jerky to TPP were $5.3 million in 2023, as compared to $33.5 million in 2022. Net revenues from retail channel sales decreased 26.6% primarily due to higher trade discounts and reduced pricing, and lower overall demand as a result of a deceleration in growth of the plant-based meat category. Net revenues from foodservice channel sales increased 2.5%, primarily from international foodservice channel sales. [/784]
[726]: Table element - Text before table: Net Revenues
We generate net revenues primarily from sales of our products to our customers across mainstream grocery, mass merchandiser, club store and natural retailer channels, and various food-away-from-home channels, including restaurants, foodservice outlets and schools, mainly in the United States and the EU.

[814]: Income Tax Expense [/814]
[815]: For 2023 and 2022, we recorded an income tax expense of $5,000 and $32,000, respectively. These amounts primarily consist of income taxes for state jurisdictions which have minimum tax requirements. No tax benefit was provided for losses incurred because those losses were offset by a full valuation allowance. [/815]
[816]: Net Loss [/816]
[817]: Net loss was $338.1 million in 2023 compared to $366.1 million in the prior year. This decrease in net loss was driven by the year-over-year decrease in operating expenses and increase in Other income, net, partially offset by the decrease in gross profit. [/817]
[818]: Non-GAAP Financial Measures [/818]
[819]: We use the non-GAAP financial measures set forth below in assessing our operating performance and in our financial communications. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful [/819]
[820]: additional information to investors about current trends in our operations and are useful for period-over-period comparisons of operations. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to assess operating performance and for business planning purposes. Management also believes these measures are widely used by investors, securities analysts, rating agencies and other parties in evaluating companies in our industry as a measure of our operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable GAAP measures. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies. [/820]

[1043]: Change in Accounting Estimate During the first quarter of 2023, the Company completed a reassessment of the useful lives of its large manufacturing equipment and research and development equipment, and determined that the Company should [/1043]

[1045]: BEYOND MEAT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES [/1045]
[1046]: Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) [/1046]
[1048]: increase the estimated useful lives for certain of its equipment from a range of 5 to 10 years to a uniform 10 years. This reassessment was accounted for as a change in accounting estimate and was made on a prospective basis effective January 1, 2023. See Note 6 . Assets Held For Sale The Company classifies long-lived assets determined to be sold as held for sale in the period in which all specified GAAP criteria are met.  The Company initially measures assets classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less costs to sell.  Any loss resulting from this measurement is recognized in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met and are recorded in selling, general, and administrative expenses. The estimated fair value are typically based on appraisals or offers from prospective buyers. In connection with Global Operations Review the Company identified certain manufacturing equipment that were no longer required for its future operations.  Upon valuation of these assets by an independent third party, the assets that were determined to be not salable were fully depreciated during the period. The assets that were determined salable were recorded in “Assets held for sale” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. Loss recognized during 2023 associated with these assets classified as held for sale was $ 16.6 million. These assets held for sale are expected to be sold within one year. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets, including property and equipment, are reviewed by management for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable. When events or circumstances indicate that impairment may be present, management evaluates the probability that future undiscounted net cash flows received will be less than the carrying amount of the asset. If projected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of an asset, then such assets are written down to their fair values. The Company concluded that no long-lived assets were impaired during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. Income Taxes The Company is subject to federal and state income taxes. The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in the authoritative guidance for accounting for income taxes. Under this method, the Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the respective carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is established against the portion of deferred tax assets that the Company believes will not be realized on a more likely than not basis. With respect to uncertain tax positions, the Company recognizes in its financial statements those tax positions determined to be more likely than not of being sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the positions. The Company’s policy is to recognize, when applicable, interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as part of income tax expense. See Note 11 . Leases The Company leases certain equipment used for research and development and operations under both finance and operating lease agreements. An asset and a corresponding liability for the finance lease obligations are established for the cost of a finance lease.

The $274 million decrease in income tax expense was primarily due to a lower effective tax rate in the fiscal twelve months ended January 1, 2023 resulting from the ability to claim certain deductions and additional foreign tax credits that were limited in the fiscal twelve months ended January 2, 2022 as a result of the talc litigation settlement.

A detailed discussion of the period-over-period changes in Segment net sales and Segment adjusted operating income for the fiscal twelve months ended January 1, 2023 and the fiscal twelve months ended January 2, 2022 can be found under the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our IPO Prospectus. [/848]
[1003]: Revenue Recognition – U.S. Net Sales [/1003]
[1004]: As described in Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s total net sales were $15.4 billion for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, of which, $6.8 billion is related to U.S. net sales. Management recognizes the revenue from these sales at a single point in time when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer depending on the terms of the contract. Trade promotions, comprised of coupons, product listing allowances, cooperative advertising arrangements, volume-based incentive programs, as well as discounts to customers, rebates, sales incentives, and product returns, are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales in the same period as the related sale. [/1004]
[1005]: 78 [/1005]
[1006]: The principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to U.S. net sales revenue recognition is a critical audit matter is a high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures related to the Company’s U.S. net sales revenue recognition. [/1006]
[1464]: 132 [/1464]
[1465]: Segment Net Sales and Segment Adjusted Operating Income [/1465]
[1466]: Segment net sales and Segment adjusted operating income for the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023, January 1, 2023, and January 2, 2022 were as follows: [/1466]
[1469]: (1) In the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company adjusted the allocation for certain intangible asset amortization costs within Cost of     Sales to align with segment financial results as measured by the Company, including the CODM. Accordingly, the Company has updated its segment disclosures to reflect the updated presentation in all prior periods. Total segment adjusted operating income did not change as a result of this update. [/1469]
[1470]: (2) Exclusive of the restructuring expenses and operating model optimization initiatives included in Other operating expense (income), net in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. [/1470]
[1471]: (3) Segment adjusted operating income excludes the impact of the conversion of stock-based awards (see Note 11, Stock-Based Compensation). This adjustment primarily represents the add-back of the net impact of the gain on reversal of previously recognized stock-based compensation expense of $ 148 million, offset by stock-based compensation expense recognized in the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023 relating to employee services provided prior to the Separation of $ 203 million. [/1471]
[1492]: 21. Selected Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited) [/1492]
[1493]: As described in Note 1, “Description of the Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” effective in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company changed its accounting principle for GILTI from the deferred approach to the period cost approach, which resulted in adjustments to the Provisions for taxes and Income before taxes line items in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other comprehensive income (loss) line in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Selected unaudited quarterly financial data has been adjusted for the change in accounting principle for the fiscal years 2023 and 2022 and is summarized below: [/1493]

[1500]: Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures [/1500]
[1501]: At the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, management of the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Thibaut Mongon, and Chief Financial Officer, Paul Ruh, reviewed and participated in this evaluation of Kenvue’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, Messrs. Mongon and Ruh concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. [/1501]

[1069]: variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales in the same period as the related sale. To estimate variable consideration, the Company may apply both the “expected value” method and the “most likely amount” method based on the form of variable consideration, after considering which method would provide the best prediction of consideration to be received from the Company’s customers. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period. The related liability is recognized within Accrued rebates, returns and promotions on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Sales returns are almost exclusively not resalable. The reserves related to sales returns are recorded at full sales value and are estimated based on historical sales and returns information. See Note 19, “Segments of Business and Geographic Areas”, for further disaggregation of net sales. Net Income Per Share The Company determines net income per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings Per Share . Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the applicable period. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares plus the effect of dilutive potential shares outstanding for the applicable period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential shares include shares from equity awards and have been excluded where their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. Separation-Related Costs The Company and J&J incurred certain non-recurring Separation-related costs in the establishment of Kenvue as a standalone public company. Costs incurred by the Company and those costs incurred by J&J determined to be for the benefit of the Company are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. These non-recurring Separation-related costs were $ 468 million and $ 213 million for the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, respectively and are included in SG&A expenses. The Company did not incur Separation-related costs in the fiscal twelve months ended January 2, 2022. Advertising Advertising expenses worldwide, which comprised television, radio, print media and digital advertising, were $ 1,349 million, $ 1,356 million, and $ 1,461 million for the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023, January 1, 2023, and January 2, 2022, respectively, and are included in SG&A expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Shipping and Handling Shipping and handling costs incurred were $ 320 million, $ 322 million, and $ 305 million for the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023, January 1, 2023, and January 2, 2022, respectively, and are included in SG&A expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Product Liability Accruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information and actuarially determined estimates where applicable. The accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. Research and Development Research and development costs were $ 399 million, $ 375 million, and $ 355 million for the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023, January 1, 2023, and January 2, 2022, respectively, and are included in SG&A expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

[822]: Table element - Text before table: Provision for taxes was $526 million and $573 million for the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, respectively, a decrease in income tax expense of $47 million. The decrease is primarily due to changes in income before taxes and tax reserve releases due to statute of limitation expirations. The decrease is offset by a reduction in our capacity to utilize foreign tax credits against U.S. foreign source income due to the increase in annual interest expense. As a result, we recorded a valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset related to future foreign tax credit benefits.

[923]: Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates [/923]
[924]: Critical accounting policies and estimates are those policies and estimates made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that are most important and material to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and which require management’s most subjective and complex judgments due to the need to select policies from among alternatives available and to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. We base our estimates on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we review our estimates to ensure that these estimates appropriately reflect changes in our business and new information as it becomes available. If historical experience and other factors we use to make these estimates do not reasonably reflect future activity, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be adversely affected. [/924]
[925]: Revenue Recognition [/925]
[926]: Our revenue contracts represent a single performance obligation to sell our products to customers. Revenue from the sale of products to customers is recognized at a single point in time when ownership, risks, and rewards transfer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer depending on the terms of the contract. Net sales exclude taxes collected by us on behalf of governmental authorities and include the shipping and handling fees charged to customers. [/926]
[1445]: Investments in Equity Securities [/1445]
[1446]: The Company measures equity investments without readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. As of December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, such investments totaled $ 71 million and $ 66 million, respectively, and were included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. [/1446]
[1447]: 128 [/1447]
[1448]: 17. Commitments and Contingencies [/1448]
[1449]: The Company and/or certain of its subsidiaries are involved from time to time in various lawsuits and claims relating to intellectual property, commercial contracts, product liability, labeling, marketing, advertising, pricing, foreign exchange controls, antitrust and trade regulation, labor and employment, indemnification, data privacy and security, environmental, health and safety, tax matters, governmental investigations, and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of their business. The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accordingly accrued for those contingent liabilities that are material and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 450-20-25. Accrued liabilities related to litigation matters are included in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including whether, among other things, damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has commenced or is complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; significant facts are in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues exist; the number of potential claims is certain or predictable; comprehensive multi-party settlements are achievable; there are complex related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. In the Company’s opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period. Product Liability The Company and/or certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits involving multiple products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive damages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. From time to time, even if it has substantial defenses, the Company considers isolated settlements based on a variety of circumstances. The Company may accrue an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the Company may accrue additional amounts such as estimated costs associated with settlements, damages, and other losses. Product liability accruals can represent projected product liability for thousands of claims around the world, each in different litigation environments and with different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be required in the future as additional information becomes available. Claims for personal injury have been made against our subsidiary Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (“JJCI”), along with other sellers of acetaminophen-containing products, in federal court alleging that in utero exposure to acetaminophen (the active ingredient in Tylenol ® , an over-the-counter pain medication) is associated with the development of autism spectrum disorder and/or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children. In October 2022, lawsuits filed in federal courts in the United States were organized as a multi-district litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. In February 2024, the Court entered final judgment in favor of JJCI and the other sellers of acetaminophen-containing products and dismissed the majority of cases then pending in the multi-district litigation. No trial dates have been set in the remaining actions. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. In addition, lawsuits have been filed in state court against JJCI, the Company and J&J, and lawsuits have been filed in Canada against our subsidiary Johnson & Johnson Inc. (Canadian affiliate) (“JJI”) and J&J. At this stage in these proceedings, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate either the likelihood or the magnitude of its potential liability arising out these claims and lawsuits. [/1449]
[1049]: 85 [/1049]
[1050]: Periods prior to the Consumer Health Business Transfer Prior to April 4, 2023, the Company operated as a segment of J&J and not as a separate entity. The Company’s financial statements prior to April 4, 2023 were derived from J&J’s historical consolidated financial statements and accounting records as if the Company had been operated on a standalone basis. Prior to the Kenvue IPO, the Company relied on J&J’s corporate and other support functions. Therefore, certain corporate and shared costs were allocated to the Company including the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses that J&J’s management determined were specifically or primarily identifiable to the Company, as well as direct and indirect costs that were attributable to the operations of the Company. Indirect costs are the costs of support functions that were provided on a centralized or geographic basis by J&J and its affiliates, which included, but were not limited to, facilities, insurance, logistics, quality, compliance, finance, human resources, benefits administration, procurement support, information technology, legal, corporate strategy, corporate governance, other professional services, and general commercial support functions. Indirect costs were allocated to the Company for the purposes of preparing combined financial statements prior to the Kenvue IPO, based on a specific identification basis or, when specific identification was not practicable, a proportional cost allocation method, primarily net sales, headcount, or other allocation methodologies that were considered to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided or benefit received by the Company during the periods presented, depending on the nature of the services received. Management considers that such allocations were made on a reasonable basis consistent with benefits received but may not necessarily be indicative"

[867]: As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, approximately 39 % and 65 %, respectively, of accounts receivable were derived from the above customers. All operating revenue derived from above customers are included in the Midstream Logistics segment. [/867]
[868]: Major Producers are defined as our producers who we gather natural gas, crude and/or produced water and process gas and dispose of produced water from and account for 10% or more of our cost of sales as presented in the consolidated financial statements. For the year ended December 31, 2023, approximately 60 % of the Company’s cost of sales were derived from three producers. For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 87 % of the Company’s cost of sales were derived from five producers. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 92 % of the Company’s cost of sales were derived from five producers. This concentration of producers may impact the Company's overall business risk, either positively or negatively, in that these entities may be similarly affected by changes in the economy or other conditions. We do not believe that a loss of revenues from any single customer would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. [/868]

[556]: Service revenue [/556]
[557]: Service revenue consists of service fees paid to the Company by its customers for providing comprehensive gathering, treating, processing and water disposal services necessary to bring natural gas, NGLs and crude oil to market. Service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023, increased by $23.8 million, or 6%, to $417.8 million, compared to $394.0 million for the same period in 2022. This increase is primarily due to a period-over-period increase in gathered and disposed of produced water volumes of 76.4 MBbls per day, or $28.2 million. Period over period gathered and processed gas volumes increased 307.4 Mcf per day and 271.5 Mcf per day, respectively. However, the total gathered and processed gas volumes where we function as the agent decreased period over period, which lead to a $3.1 million decrease in service fees. Over 99% of service revenues are included in the Midstream Logistics segment. [/557]
[558]: Product revenue [/558]
[559]: Product revenue consists of commodity sales (including condensate, natural gas residue and NGLs). Product revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023, increased by $16.1 million, or 2%, to $822.4 million, compared to $806.4 million for the same period in 2022, primarily due to a period-over-period increase in NGL and condensate sales volumes. NGL and condensate sales volumes increased 14.7 million barrels, or over 80%. The increase in volume was partially offset by decreases in c ondensate prices of $22.38 per barrel, or 24%, and decreases of NGL prices of $14.31 per barrel, or 40%. In addition, natural gas residue sales volumes increased 0.5 million MMBtu, or 2%, but fully offsetting this increase in residue volumes, natural gas prices decreased period-over-period $3.84 per MMBtu, or 69%. Product revenues are included entirely in the Midstream Logistics segment. [/559]

[661]: Business Combination [/661]
[662]: For acquired businesses, we recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition with any excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired recorded to goodwill. Determining the fair value of these items requires management’s judgment and/or the utilization of independent valuation specialists and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the investee, as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability, can materially impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition, such as through depreciation and amortization expense. See Note 3—Business Combination in our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for more information regarding our valuation approach. [/662]
[591]: Reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measure [/591]
[592]: Company management compensates for the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA as an analytical tool by reviewing the comparable GAAP measure, understanding the differences between Adjusted EBITDA as compared to net income including noncontrolling interests, and incorporating this knowledge into its decision-making processes. Management believes that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measure that the Company uses in evaluating operating results. [/592]
[593]: The following table presents a reconciliation of the GAAP financial measure of net income including noncontrolling interests to the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA. [/593]

[571]: • Product sales and Cost of goods sold: Product sales include predominantly fixed price manufacturing and supply agreements with our collaboration partners and are the result of firm purchase orders from those partners. Accordingly, the revenue recognized in a given period is based solely on the demand and requirements of our collaboration partners and is not ratable throughout the year. We expect product sales to increase for 2024 as compared to 2023 due to increased demand from our partners with a corresponding increase in cost of goods sold. [/571]

[291]: Table of Contents NORTHWEST BIOTHERAPEUTICS, INC. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not consolidate any VIE’s as the Company has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary. Use of Estimates In preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Due to inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be affected by changes in these estimates. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments, including valuing equity securities in share-based payment arrangements, estimating the fair value of financial instruments recorded as derivative liabilities, useful lives of depreciable assets and whether impairment charges may apply. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist of cash accounts in a financial institution, which at times may exceed the Federal depository insurance coverage (“FDIC”) of $ 250,000 . As of December 31, 2023, of the total $ 2.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, $ 36,000 was held by foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2022, of the total $ 7.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, $ 0.4 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. The Company had not experienced losses on these accounts and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such accounts. Property, Plant and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided for using straight-line methods, in amounts sufficient to charge the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated service lives. Repairs and maintenance costs are charged to operations as incurred. Costs for capital assets not yet placed into service are capitalized as construction in progress on the consolidated balance sheets and will be depreciated once placed into service. In October 2021, approval was received from the UK Human Tissue Authority (“HTA”) of a license for collection and processing of human cells and tissues for medical purposes at the Company’s Sawston, UK facility. In December 2021, approval was received from the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) of a license for manufacture at the Sawston facility of GMP (clinical grade) cell therapy products for compassionate use and trials. All costs associated with the facility buildout (Phase 1A) were reclassified from construction in progress to leasehold improvements, and the costs began to be amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset and/or leasehold lease. The Company incurred additional construction works related to Phase 1B build out during the year ended December 31, 2022, which was completed and placed in use in 2023. F-11 [/291]
[294]: Table of Contents NORTHWEST BIOTHERAPEUTICS, INC. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions The Company has operations in the United Kingdom and Netherlands in addition to the U.S. The Company translated its assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars using end of period exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars using weighted average rates. Foreign currency translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders’ equity deficit. The Company converts receivables and payables denominated in other than the Company’s functional currency at the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date. The resulting transaction exchange gains or losses related to intercompany receivable and payables, are included in other income and expense. Comprehensive Loss The Company reports comprehensive loss and its components in its consolidated financial statements. Comprehensive loss consists of net loss and foreign currency translation adjustments, affecting stockholders’ equity deficit that, under U.S, GAAP, is excluded from net loss. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the terms stipulated under the applicable service contract. In various situations, the Company receives certain credits against invoices for manufacturing of patient treatments by its contract manufacturer. These payments are assessed and recognized in accordance with ASC 606 in the period when the performance obligation had been met. Accrued Outsourcing Costs Substantial portions of our preclinical studies and clinical trials are performed by third-party laboratories, medical centers, contract research organizations and other vendors (collectively “CROs”). These CROs generally bill monthly or quarterly for services performed, or bill based upon milestones achieved. For clinical studies, expenses are accrued when services are performed. The Company monitors patient enrollment, the progress of clinical studies and related activities through internal reviews of data that is tracked by the CROs under contractual arrangements, correspondence with the CROs and visits to clinical sites. Research and Development Costs Research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred and consist primarily of clinical trial related costs (including costs for collection, validation and analysis of trial results), related party manufacturing costs, consulting costs, contract research and development costs, clinical site costs and compensation costs. Income Taxes The Company evaluates its tax positions and estimates its current tax exposure along with assessing temporary differences that result from different book to tax treatment of items not currently deductible for tax purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets, which are estimated based upon the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse. In general, deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized. Accordingly, realization of the Company’s deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income against which these deductions, losses and credits can be utilized. F-14 [/294]

[408]: Basic earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net earnings (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share is computed similar to basic earnings (loss) per common share except that it reflects the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities or other obligations to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. Diluted weighted average common shares include common stock potentially issuable under the Company’s convertible notes, warrants and vested and unvested stock options. [/408]

[295]: Table of Contents NORTHWEST BIOTHERAPEUTICS, INC. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The Company must assess the likelihood that the Company’s deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income, and to the extent the Company believes that recovery is not more likely than not, the Company must establish a valuation allowance. Management judgment is required in determining the Company’s provision for income taxes, the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against the Company’s net deferred tax assets. Excluding foreign operations, the Company recorded a full valuation allowance at each balance sheet date presented because, based on the available evidence, the Company believes it is more likely than not that it will not be able to utilize all of its deferred tax assets in the future. The Company intends to maintain the full valuation allowance until sufficient evidence exists to support the reversal of the valuation allowance. Stock-Based Compensation The Company measures stock-based compensation to employees, consultants, and Board members at fair value on the grant date of the award. Compensation cost is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. For awards that have a performance condition, compensation cost is measured based on the fair value of the award on the grant date, the date performance targets are established, and is expensed over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche when achievement of the performance condition becomes probable. The Company assess the probability of the performance conditions being met on a continuous basis. Forfeitures are recognized when they occur. Prior to January 1, 2019, share-based compensation cost for non-employees was re-measured at every reporting period. The Company estimates the fair value of stock option grants that do not contain market-based vesting conditions using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent management’s best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. Expected Term - The expected term of options represents the period that the Company’s stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding based on the simplified method, which is the half-life from vesting to the end of its contractual term. Expected Volatility - The Company computes stock price volatility over expected terms based on its historical common stock trading prices. Risk-Free Interest Rate - The Company bases the risk-free interest rate on the implied yield available on U. S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term. Expected Dividend - The Company has never declared or paid any cash dividends on its common shares and does not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future, and, therefore, uses an expected dividend yield of zero in its valuation models. The Company is also required to make estimates as to the probability of achieving the specific performance conditions. If actual results are not consistent with the Company’s assumptions and judgments used in making these estimates, the Company may be required to increase or decrease compensation expense, which could be material to the Company’s consolidated results of operations. Debt Extinguishment The Company accounts for the income or loss from extinguishment of debt by comparing the difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying amount of the debt being extinguished and recognizes this as gain or loss when the debt is extinguished. The gain or loss from debt extinguishment is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations under “other income (expense)” as loss from extinguishment of convertible debt. F-15 [/295]
[129]: Table of Contents Derivative Financial Instruments The Company has derivative financial instruments that are not hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are recorded in other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company assesses its long-lived assets for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be fully recoverable. To analyze recoverability, the Company projects undiscounted net future cash flows over the remaining lives of such assets. If these projected cash flows are less than the carrying amounts, an impairment loss would be recognized, resulting in a write-down of the assets with a corresponding charge to earnings. The impairment loss is measured based upon the difference between the carrying amounts and the fair values of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amounts or fair value less cost to sell. Management determines fair value using the discounted cash flow method or other accepted valuation techniques. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the undiscounted net future cash flows of the U.K. property were greater than the carrying value. Therefore, no impairment loss was considered necessary. Sequencing The Company adopted a sequencing policy under ASC 815-40-35 to determine if reclassification of contracts from equity to liabilities is necessary pursuant to ASC 815 due to the Company’s inability to demonstrate if it has sufficient authorized shares. Certain contracts were classified as liabilities as the result of the instruments containing a potentially indeterminable number of shares and, most recently, due to the Company entering into agreements providing for the potential issuance of more shares than authorized. While temporary agreements are in place to keep the potential exercises beneath the number authorized, certain instruments are classified as liabilities, after allocating available authorized shares on the basis of the earliest grant date of potentially dilutive instruments. Pursuant to ASC 815, issuance of stock-based awards to the Company’s employees, non-employees or directors are not subject to the sequencing policy. On January 9, 2023, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment of its Seventh Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Certificate of Amendment”) with the Secretary of the State of Delaware, which effected an increase in the Company’s authorized shares of common stock, from 1.2 billion to 1.7 billion, par value $0.001 per share. As a result of this increase in authorized shares, the liability-classified warrants were reclassified to equity. Approximate 141 million warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock were classified as liabilities through January 8, 2023. Modification of Equity Classified Warrants A change in the terms or conditions of a warrant is accounted for as a modification. For a warrant modification accounted for under ASC 815, the effect of a modification shall be measured as the difference between the fair value of the modified warrant over and the fair value of the original warrant immediately before its terms are modified, with each measured on the modification date. The accounting for any incremental fair value of the modified warrants over the original warrants is based on the specific facts and circumstances related to the modification. When a modification is directly attributable to an equity offering, the incremental change in fair value of the warrants is accounted for as an equity issuance cost. When a modification is directly attributable to a debt financing, the incremental change in fair value of the warrants is accounted for as a debt discount or debt issuance cost. For all other modifications, the incremental change in fair value is recognized as a deemed dividend. Convertible Notes under Fair Value Option We account for certain convertible notes issued from August to October 2023 on an instrument-by-instrument basis under the fair value option (“FVO”) election of ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments (“ASC 825”). The convertible notes accounted for under the FVO election are each debt host financial instruments containing embedded features wherein the entire financial instrument is initially measured at its issue-date estimated fair value and then subsequently remeasured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis at each reporting period date. Changes in the estimated fair value of the convertible notes are recorded as a component of Other (expense) income in the consolidated statements of operations, except that the change in estimated fair value attributable to a change in the instrument-specific credit risks is recognized as a component of other comprehensive income. As a result of electing the FVO, issuance costs related to the convertible notes are expensed as incurred. 26 [/129]
[132]: Table of Contents For the Years Ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 We recognized a net loss of $62.6 million, $105.0 million and a net income of $179.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The net loss of $62.6 million and $105.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 included a non-cash gain of $1.5 million and a non-cash loss of $25.8 million from change in fair value derivative liabilities and convertible notes, respectively. The net income of $179.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 included a non-cash gain of $239.3 million from change in fair value derivative liabilities. Net cash used in operations was $53.6 million, $52.8 million and $38.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Research and development expense For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, research and development expense was $27.7 million, $35.5 million and $20.3 million, respectively. The increase in R&D in 2023 and 2022 as compared to 2021 was mainly reflected extensive one-time activities, which were started in mid of 2022 and fully completed as of December 31, 2023. The R&D expenses in 2023 and 2022 primarily reflected extensive one-time activities (i) to accomplish a number of pre-requisites that are required before making an application for regulatory of DCVax-L, (ii) to prepare the application package and (iii) to prepare other materials, such as the Trial Master File, to be inspection-ready in addition to the application package. The pre-requisites and preparations included developing, submitting and obtaining regulatory approval for a Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP), preparing and qualifying for manufacturing licenses required for the Sawston facility, completing the technology transfer from the London facility (where the Company had done all its manufacturing before 2022) to the Sawston facility to enable GMP manufacturing to begin in February 2022 at Sawston (while also continuing in the London facility), and six workstreams related to product matters involving Comparability, Stability, Potency, Product Profile, Mechanism of Action and Fill/Finish which are needed for the application package to seek regulatory approval of DCVax-L. The 2023 and 2022 R&D expenses we incurred for these activities included payments to numerous teams of specialized external consultants and the CRO, as well as to Advent BioServices. The majority of the payments to Advent were for one-time expenses for ten key one-time milestones for pre-requisites and preparations for the MAA application for product approval. These included three milestones for obtaining the three licenses required for the Sawston facility, six milestones for the six product workstreams, and 1 milestone related to preparing key portions of an application for regulatory approval of the DCVax-L product. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we completed the last three one-time milestones (obtaining a commercial manufacturing license from the MHRA, completion of drafting and submission of the application to MHRA for product approval), and recognized additional $1.5 million in research and development expense. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we paid $3.0 million for the cash component of seven milestones, and accrued $4.7 million for the cash component of future milestones. We issued 7.5 million shares at fair value of $5.9 million for the stock component of eight milestones, and we accrued $3.6 million for the stock component of future milestones. General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expenses were $29.7 million, $33.4 million and $33.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease of $3.6 million in 2023 compared to 2022 was mainly related to a decrease of $1.6 million in consulting, legal and professional fees, a decrease of $0.7 million in compensation expenses and a $0.9 million reduction in our director and officer insurance expenses. Expenses incurred in 2022 and 2021 were consistent with rounding, but there was a slight decrease of approximate $46,000 which was mainly related to a decrease of $7.0 million stock-based compensation that represented the vesting of a portion of previously granted equity-based awards, and that was recognized in general and administrative expense, and offset by an increase of approximately $1.8 million related to legal and professional expenses, an increase of $1.5 million in insurance premiums, an increase of $1.6 million related 29 [/132]

[1605]: The cost associated with pre-launch activities performed by the Company is recorded within total operating expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.  In the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 , the Company recognized $ 1,446 , $ 6,102 , and $ 2,168 in research and development expenses and $ 4,242 , $ 8,953 , and $ 3,383 in general and administrative expenses, respectively, associated with pre-launch activities performed. The pre-launch activities were completed prior to the first commercial sale of VOWST, which occurred in June 2023. [/1605]
[1606]: Under the 2021 License Agreement with Nestlé, beginning with the first commercial sale of VOWST, which occurred in June 2023, net sales of VOWST are recorded by Nestlé and include gross sales net of discounts, rebates, allowances, and other applicable deductions. These amounts include the use of estimates and judgments, which could be adjusted based on actual results in the future. The Company records its share of the profits or losses from the sales of VOWST, including commercial and medical affairs expenses incurred by the Company, on a net basis, as collaboration (profit) loss sharing - related party. This treatment is in accordance with the Company’s revenue recognition and collaboration policy, given that Nestlé and the Company are both active participants in commercialization activities and are exposed to significant risks and rewards that are dependent on the commercial success of the activities in the 2021 License Agreement. Nestlé provides the Company with reporting related to net sales of VOWST in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles in order to calculate and record collaboration profit or loss. [/1606]
[1408]: Grant Revenue The Company generates revenue from government contracts that reimburse the Company for certain allowable costs for funded projects. For contracts with government agencies, when the Company has concluded that it is the principal in conducting the research and development expenses, and where the funding arrangement is considered central to the Company’s ongoing operations, the Company classifies the recognized funding received as revenue. [/1408]
[1409]: The Company has concluded to recognize funding received as revenue, rather than as a reduction of research and development expenses, because the Company is the principal in conducting the research and development activities and these contracts are central to its ongoing operations. Revenue is recognized as the qualifying expenses related to the contracts are incurred. Revenue recognized upon incurring qualifying expenses in advance of receipt of funding is recorded in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as accounts receivable. The related costs incurred by the Company are included in research and development expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. [/1409]
[1382]: 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies [/1382]
[1383]: Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. In these consolidated financial statements, the Company uses estimates and assumptions related to revenue recognition and the accrual of research and development expenses. Estimates are periodically reviewed in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. Actual results could differ from the Company’s estimates. [/1383]
[1384]: Cash Equivalents The Company considers all short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less at acquisition date to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents, which consist of money market accounts, commercial paper and corporate bonds purchased with original maturities of less than 90 days from the date of purchase, are stated at fair value.

[1031]: We expect that our general and administrative expenses will decrease starting in 2024 as the Restructuring Plan is expected to result in a reduction of personnel expenses due the workforce reduction and a reduction in external expenses including the elimination of non-essential expenses and consolidation of office space.  General and administrative expenses may increase as we undertake efforts from time to time to raise additional capital. We may also continue to incur increased expenses associated with being a public company, including increased costs of accounting, audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing rules and the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, director and officer insurance costs and investor and public relations costs.

[1343]: to Nestlé, which represents the excess of the supply price paid by Nestlé over the Company's cost to manufacture VOWST, subject to a supply price cap applicable to product manufactured prior to commercial launch. [/1343]
[1344]: The principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to the recognition of collaboration (profit) loss sharing arising from the license agreement with Nestlé is a critical audit matter is a high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures related to the Company’s recognition of collaboration (profit) loss sharing. [/1344]
[1345]: Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included, among others (i) evaluating management’s collaboration (profit) loss sharing accounting policy; (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of certain data used to calculate the collaboration (profit) loss sharing by sending a confirmation and obtaining and inspecting source documents provided by Nestlé; (iii) recalculating the Company’s share of the profit or losses from the sales of VOWST; and (iv) recalculating the Company’s profit on transfer of VOWST inventory to Nestlé and obtaining and inspecting source documents, such as invoices and evidence of payment. [/1345]
[1603]: The Company considers the collaborative pre-launch activities and commercialization activities to be separate units of account within the scope of Topic 808 and are not performance obligations under Topic 606. The Company and Nestlé were both active participants in the pre-launch activities and commercialization activities and were exposed to significant risks and rewards that were dependent on the commercial success of the activities in the arrangement. The amount allocated to the Topic 808 unit of accounting relates to the pre-launch activities performed prior to the first commercial sale of VOWST and was determined to be $ 35,500 based on standalone selling price. [/1603]
[1604]: The Company recorded the $ 35,500 in total liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets at the inception of the arrangement. On a quarterly basis, the Company and Nestlé provided financial information about the pre-launch activities performed by both parties.  The Company reduced the $ 35,500 liability as the pre-launch activities were performed and it made payments to Nestlé for the pre-launch costs Nestlé incurred. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022 , there was $ 10,064 and $ 34,770 , respectively, included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities which represents costs incurred by Nestlé for pre-launch activities that have not yet been reimbursed by Seres. [/1604]
[541]: We rely on Nestlé to provide information related to the commercialization of VOWST so that we can make strategic decisions and projections, and we may provide this data, or statements based upon this data, to investors. If the data Nestlé provides us is inaccurate or incomplete, it may adversely affect our financial statements, business operations, the commercial success of VOWST or our stock price. [/541]
[542]: 42 [/542]
[543]: Under the 2021 License Agreement, VOWST net sales are recorded by Nestlé and include gross sales net of discounts, rebates, allowances, and other applicable deductions. We rely on Nestlé to provide reporting related to net sales of VOWST in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles in order to calculate and record collaboration profit or loss. We also rely on Nestlé to provide timely, accurate and complete information related to the commercialization of VOWST, including data on prescribers, prescriptions and new patient starts. We use the information provided to us by Nestlé to report our results of operations, to plan for our future operations, and to make strategic decisions and projections, which may prove to be inaccurate or suboptimal. We base some of our strategic decisions and projections on the data Nestlé provides and we may provide this information to investors and analysts who may make their own predictions and estimates, all of which may prove to be inaccurate. Any failure by Nestlé to provide accurate and complete information related to the commercialization of VOWST, or to provide it on a timely basis, could adversely impact our financial statements, business operations, the commercial success of VOWST or our stock price.

[1394]: approximates a market interest rate. The warrant liabilities associated with the Company's credit facility with Oaktree for which there is no current market and the determination of fair value requires significant estimation are classified as Level 3 financial liabilities. [/1394]
[1395]: Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value with cost based on the first-in first-out method. Inventory that can be used in either the production of clinical or commercial products is expensed as research and development costs when identified for use in clinical trials. Prior to the regulatory approval of its product candidates, the Company incurs expenses for the manufacture of drug product supplies to support clinical development that could potentially be available to support the commercial launch of those drugs. Until the date at which regulatory approval has been received or is otherwise considered probable, the Company records all such costs as research and development expenses. [/1395]
[1589]: During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 using the cost-to-cost method, which best depicts the transfer of control to the customer, the Company recognized ($ 650 ), $ 3,014 , and $ 10,446 of collaboration revenue – related party, respectively, relating to the 2016 License Agreement. [/1589]
[1590]: As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there was $ 95,364 , and $ 96,689 of deferred revenue related to the unsatisfied portion of the performance obligation under the Nestlé agreements. As of December 31, 2023, deferred revenue is classified as current or non-current in the consolidated balance sheets based on the Company’s estimate of revenue that will be recognized within the next twelve months, which is determined by the cost-to-cost method which measures the extent of progress towards completion based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to the total estimated costs expected upon satisfying the performance obligation. All costs associated with the 2016 License Agreement are recorded in research and development expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. [/1590]
[1413]: Segment Data The Company manages its operations as a single segment for the purposes of assessing performance and making operating decisions. The Company’s singular focus is on developing microbiome therapeutics to treat the modulation of the colonic microbiome. Revenue to date has been generated solely through the Company's agreements with its collaborators, all of which has been earned in the United States. All tangible assets are held in the United States. [/1413]
[1414]: Comprehensive Loss Comprehensive loss includes net loss as well as other changes in stockholders’ equity (deficit) that result from transactions and economic events other than those with stockholders. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 , other comprehensive income (loss) consisted of changes in unrealized gains (losses) from available-for-sale investments and a currency translation adjustment. [/1414]
[1415]: Net Loss per Share Basic net loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed using the sum of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period and, if dilutive, the weighted average number of potential shares of common stock, including the assumed exercise of stock options and unvested restricted stock. The Company applies the two-class method to calculate its basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to F- 15 SERES THERAPEUTICS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (amounts in thousands, except share and per share data) common stockholders. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that treats a participating security as having rights to earnings that otherwise would have been available to common stockholders. However, the two-class method does not impact the net loss per share of common stock as the Company was in a net loss position for each of the periods presented. The Company’s restricted stock awards entitle the holder of such awards to dividends declared or paid by the board of directors, regardless of whether such awards are unvested, as if such shares were outstanding common shares at the time of the dividend. However, the unvested restricted stock awards are not entitled to share in the residual net assets (deficit) of the Company. Accordingly, in periods in which the Company reports a net loss attributable to common stockholders, diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders, since dilutive common shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive. [/1415]
[1407]: Collaboration Revenue Arrangements with collaborators may include licenses to intellectual property, research and development services, manufacturing services for clinical and commercial supply, and participation on joint steering committees. The Company evaluates the promised goods or services to determine which promises, or group of promises, represent performance obligations. In contemplation of whether a promised good or service meets the criteria required of a performance obligation, the Company considers the stage of development of the underlying intellectual property, the capabilities and expertise of the customer relative to the underlying intellectual property, and whether the promised goods or services are integral to or dependent on other promises in the contract. When accounting for an arrangement that contains multiple performance obligations, the Company must develop judgmental assumptions, which may include market conditions, reimbursement rates for personnel costs, development timelines and probabilities of regulatory success to determine the stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract. When the Company concludes that a contract should be accounted for as a combined performance obligation and recognized over time, the Company must then determine the period over which revenue should be recognized and the method by which to measure revenue. The Company generally recognizes revenue using a cost-based input method. Licenses of intellectual property If a license to the Company’s intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, the Company recognizes revenue allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the F- 13 SERES THERAPEUTICS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (amounts in thousands, except share and per share data) customer is able to use and benefit from the license.  For licenses that are bundled with other promises, the Company utilizes judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue associated with the bundled performance obligation.  The Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of progress and related revenue recognition. Milestone Payments At the inception of each arrangement that includes developmental and regulatory milestone payments, the Company evaluates whether the achievement of each milestone specifically relates to the Company’s efforts to satisfy a performance obligation or transfer a distinct good or service within a performance obligation. If the achievement of a milestone is considered a direct result of the Company’s efforts to satisfy a performance obligation or transfer a distinct good or service and the receipt of the payment is based upon the achievement of the milestone, the associated milestone value is allocated to that distinct good or service, otherwise it will be allocated to all performance obligations of the arrangement based on the initial allocation. The Company evaluates each milestone to determine when and how much of the milestone to include in the transaction price.  The Company first estimates the amount of the milestone payment that the Company could receive using either the expected value or the most likely amount approach. The Company primarily uses the most likely amount approach as that approach is generally most predictive for milestone payments with a binary outcome. Then, the Company considers whether any portion of that estimated amount is subject to the variable consideration constraint (that is, whether it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue would not occur upon resolution of the uncertainty). The Company updates the estimate of variable consideration included in the transaction price at each reporting date which includes updating the assessment of the likely amount of consideration and the application of the constraint to reflect current facts and circumstances. Royalties For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, the Company will recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). To date, the Company has no t recognized any revenue related to sales-based royalties or milestone payments based on the level of sales. Manufacturing supply services For arrangements that include a promise of supply of clinical or commercial product, the Company determines if the supply is a promise in the contract or a future obligation at the customer’s option. If determined to be a promise at inception of the contract, the Company evaluates the promise to determine whether it is a separate performance obligation or a component of a bundled performance obligation. If determined to be an option, the Company determines if the option provides a material right to the customer and if so, accounts for the option as a separate performance obligation. If determined to be an option but not a material right, the Company accounts for the option as a separate contract when the customer elects to exercise the option. [/1407]
[1047]: Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates [/1047]
[1048]: Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events. These estimates and judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. We believe that the estimates and assumptions involved in the accounting policies described below may have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements and, therefore, consider these to be our critical accounting policies. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. [/1048]
[1111]: Collaboration (Profit) Loss Sharing - related party [/1111]
[1112]: Collaboration (profit) loss sharing – related party resulted in $0.7 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $1.0 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2022. Beginning with the commercial launch of VOWST in June 2023, we record our share of the net profits and losses from the sales of VOWST, which are recorded by Nestlé and include gross sales net of discounts, rebates, allowances, and other applicable deductions, as collaboration (profit) loss sharing - related party. Our share of VOWST net profits and losses also includes commercial and medical affairs expenses incurred by us. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our share of the VOWST net loss was $18.9 million. We also record as collaboration (profit) loss sharing - related party our net profit on the transfer of VOWST to Nestlé, as well as our share of pre-launch expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2023, these amounts were $23.3 million in net profit and $5.1 million in net loss, respectively. [/1112]
[1065]: When we conclude that a contract should be accounted for as a combined performance obligation and recognized over time, we must then determine the period over which revenue should be recognized and the method by which to measure revenue. We generally recognize revenue using a cost-based input method. [/1065]
[1066]: Licenses of Intellectual Property [/1066]
[1067]: If a license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenue allocated to the license when the license is transferred to our customer and our customer is able to use and benefit from the license.  For licenses that are bundled with other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue associated with the bundled performance obligation.  We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjust the measure of progress and related revenue recognition. [/1067]
[1113]: For the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred $15.1 million of pre-launch expenses which we recorded within research and development expense or general and administrative expense based on the nature of the underlying expense, and our collaborative partner incurred $17.1 million of pre-launch expenses. The $1.0 million of expense recorded for the year ended December 31, 2022 represent the sharing of 50% of the pre-launch expenses. These amounts represent expense to us in 2022 because our collaborative partner performed more of the pre-launch activities than us. [/1113]

[1127]: Estimates [/1127]
[1129]: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. [/1129]

[102]: Non-GAAP Financial Measures [/102]
[103]: Adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share are financial measures that are not determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income for common stock or net income per share, respectively, each of which is an indicator of financial performance determined in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share exclude from net income for common stock and net income per share, respectively, certain other items that the company does not consider indicative of its ongoing financial performance. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate the analysis of the company's financial performance as compared to its internal budgets and previous financial results and to communicate to investors and others the company’s expectations regarding its future earnings and dividends on its common stock. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are also useful and meaningful to investors to facilitate their analysis of the company's financial performance. The following table is a reconciliation of Con Edison’s reported net income for common stock to adjusted earnings and reported earnings per share to adjusted earnings per share. [/103]

[1085]: Revenues CECONY’s electric and gas rate plans and O&R’s New York electric and gas rate plans each contain a revenue decoupling mechanism, that covers all residential and most commercial customers, under which the company’s actual energy delivery revenues are compared with the authorized delivery revenues and the difference accrued, with interest, for refund to, or recovery from, customers, as applicable. See “Rate Plans” in Note B. [/1085]
[1086]: The NYSPSC requires utilities to record gross receipts tax revenues and expenses on a gross income statement presentation basis (i.e., included in both revenue and expense). The recovery of these taxes is generally provided for in the revenue requirement within each of the respective NYSPSC-approved rate plans. Total excise taxes (inclusive of gross receipts taxes) recorded in operating revenues were as follows: [/1086]

[1183]: E. Segment and Related Information [/1183]
[1184]: Segment Information [/1184]
[1185]: Alcoa Corporation is a producer of bauxite, alumina, and aluminum products. Beginning in January 2023, the financial information provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) for the activities of the bauxite mines and the alumina refineries was combined into the Alumina segment, and accordingly the Company changed its operating segments. Beginning with the first quarter of 2023, the Company reported its financial results in the following two segments: (i) Alumina and (ii) Aluminum. Segment information for all prior periods presented has been updated to reflect the new segment structure. Segment performance under Alcoa Corporation’s management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors; however, the primary measure of performance is the Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) for each segment. The Company calculates Segment Adjusted EBITDA as Total sales (third-party and intersegment) minus the following items: Cost of goods sold; Selling, general administrative, and other expenses; and Research and development expenses. Alcoa Corporation’s Segment Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The CODM function regularly reviews the financial information, including Adjusted EBITDA, of these two operating segments to assess performance and allocate resources. [/1185]

The CODM function regularly reviews the financial information, including Adjusted EBITDA, of these two operating segments to assess performance and allocate resources. [/746]
[747]: Segment Adjusted EBITDA totaled $734 in 2023 and $2,280 in 2022. The following information provides production, shipments, sales, and Segment Adjusted EBITDA data for each reportable segment, as well as certain realized price and average cost data, for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023. [/747]
[868]: Table element - Text before table: (3) Provision for depreciation, depletion, and amortization is included in the operating costs used to calculate average cost for each of the alumina and aluminum product divisions (see Alumina and Aluminum above). However, for financial reporting purposes, Provision for depreciation, depletion, and amortization is presented as a separate line item on Alcoa Corporation’s Statement of Consolidated Operations.
(4) Other includes costs related to Transformation, and certain other items that are not included in the operating costs of segments (see footnotes 1 and 3 in the Reconciliation of Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA to Consolidated Net (Loss) Income Attributable to Alcoa Corporation below).

[1014]: The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of Alcoa Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company) were prepared by management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and include amounts that are based on management’s best judgments and estimates. The other financial information included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 is consistent with that in the Consolidated Financial Statements. [/1014]

[961]: A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies is included in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K in Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements. [/961]
[962]: Properties, Plants, and Equipment. Properties, plants, and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets (asset group) may not be recoverable, including in the period when assets have met the criteria to be classified as held for sale. The model used to determine recoverability of an asset or asset group would leverage the model that management uses for planning and strategic review of the entire business, including related inputs and assumptions. Management’s impairment assessment process is described in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K in Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K in Note K to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding properties, plants, and equipment. [/962]
[963]: Goodwill. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually (in the fourth quarter) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell or exit a business. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include, among others, deterioration in general economic conditions, negative developments in equity and credit markets, adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates, increases in input costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows, or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods. The fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate goodwill for impairment. [/963]
[666]: Annual Comparison [/666]
[667]: Overview [/667]
[668]: Net loss attributable to Alcoa Corporation increased $528 primarily as a result of: [/668]

[676]: • Lower energy costs, primarily in Europe [/676]
[677]: • Favorable currency impacts [/677]
[678]: Sales [/678]
[679]: Sales decreased $1,900 primarily as a result of: [/679]
[680]: • Lower average realized prices of aluminum and alumina [/680]
[681]: • Lower shipments across both segments [/681]
[682]: • Lower trading activities [/682]
[683]: • Decrease in value add product sales [/683]

[956]: Long-term debt and Short-term borrowings—Total debt amounts in the preceding table represent the principal amounts of all outstanding long-term debt and Short-term borrowings, which have maturities that extend to 2029. [/956]
[957]: 68 [/957]
[958]: Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates [/958]
[959]: The preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates based on judgments and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Areas that require such estimates include the review of properties, plants, and equipment and goodwill for impairment, and accounting for each of the following: asset retirement and environmental obligations; litigation matters; pension plans and other postretirement benefits obligations; derivatives and hedging activities; and income taxes. [/959]
[960]: Management uses historical experience and all available information to make these estimates; actual results may differ from those used to prepare the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements at any given time. Despite these inherent limitations, management believes that the amounts recorded in the financial statements related to these items are based on its best estimates and judgments using all relevant information available at the time.

[1106]: Litigation Matters. For asserted claims and assessments, liabilities are recorded when an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be probable and the loss is reasonably estimable. With respect to unasserted claims or assessments, liabilities are recorded when the probability that an assertion will be made is likely, an unfavorable outcome of the matter is deemed to be probable, and the loss is reasonably estimable. Legal matters are reviewed on a continuous basis to determine if there has been a change in management’s judgment regarding the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the estimate of a potential loss. Legal costs, which are primarily for general litigation, environmental compliance, tax disputes, and general corporate matters, are expensed as incurred. [/1106]
[1107]: Revenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation(s) in accordance with the provisions of a customer order or contract. This is achieved when control of the product has been transferred to the customer, which is generally determined when title, ownership, and risk of loss pass to the customer, all of which occurs upon shipment or delivery of the product. The shipping terms vary across all businesses and depend on the product, the country of origin, and the type of transportation. Accordingly, the sale of Alcoa’s products to its customers represent single performance obligations for which revenue is recognized at a point in time, except for the Company’s Energy product division in which the customer simultaneously receives and consumes electricity (see Note E). Revenue is based on the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for its products. Returns and other adjustments have not been material. Based on the foregoing, no significant judgment is required to determine when control of a product has been transferred to a customer. The Company considers shipping and handling activities as costs to fulfill the promise to transfer the related products. As a result, customer payments of shipping and handling costs are recorded as a component of revenue. Taxes collected (e.g., sales, use, value added, excise) from its customers related to the sale of its products are remitted to governmental authorities and excluded from Sales. [/1107]

[711]: Basis of Accounting The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). [/711]
[712]: Use of Estimates The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates include, but are not limited to, the allocation of purchase price between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the fair value of long-lived assets and goodwill utilized in impairment assessments, the depreciable lives of rental property, the amortizable lives of intangible assets and liabilities, the probability of collecting outstanding and future lease payments, the fair value of the earnout liability, and the fair value of the Company’s interest rate swap agreements. Accordingly, actual results may differ from those estimates. [/712]

[653]: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Broadstone Net Lease, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

[601]: Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates [/601]
[602]: The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses as well as other disclosures in the financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and assumptions; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions, which in turn could have a material impact on our financial statements. A summary of our significant accounting policies and procedures are included in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”, contained in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

[633]: When an existing cash flow hedge is terminated, we determine the accounting treatment for the accumulated gain or loss recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), based on the probability of the hedged forecasted transaction occurring within the period the cash flow hedge was anticipated to affect earnings. If management determines that the hedged forecasted transaction is probable of occurring during the original period, the accumulated gain or loss is reclassified into earnings over the remaining life of the cash flow hedge using a straight-line method. If management determines that the hedged forecasted transaction is not probable of occurring during the original period, the entire amount of accumulated gain or loss is reclassified into earnings at such time.

[295]: Table of Contents EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ​ In 2023, we delivered high single digit sales growth as we continued strong pricing. Our strong pricing offset continued delivered product cost increases. Our team generated double-digit sales growth in Institutional & Specialty, high single digit sales growth in Industrial, and Other segments while Healthcare and Life Sciences generated good sales growth. Operating income grew by strong double digits, as strong pricing and cost savings initiatives overcame investments in the business and higher supply chain costs. ​ Sales ​ Reported sales increased 8% to $15.3 billion in 2023 from $14.2 billion in 2022. When measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange, fixed currency sales increased 8% compared to the prior year. Organic sales increased 9% compared to the prior year. ​ Gross Margin ​ Our reported gross margin was 40.2% of sales for 2023, compared to our 2022 reported gross margin of 37.8%. Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges included in cost of sales, our adjusted gross margin was 40.4% in 2023 and 38.2% in 2022. Our gross profit increased as our strong pricing exceeded delivered product cost inflation. ​ Operating Income ​ Reported operating income increased 28% to $2.0 billion in 2023, compared to $1.6 billion in 2022. Adjusted operating income, excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges increased 20% in 2023 as strong pricing overcame investments in the business including incentive compensation, unfavorable mix and higher supply chain costs. Organic operating income increased 20% in 2023. ​ Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Ecolab Per Common Share (“EPS”) ​ Reported diluted EPS increased 26% to $4.79 in 2023 compared to $3.81 in 2022. Special (gains) and charges had an impact on both years. Special (gains) and charges in 2023 were driven primarily by restructuring expense and 2022 was driven primarily by restructuring and pension settlement expense. Adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes the impact of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items increased 16% to $5.21 in 2023 compared to $4.49 in 2022 as our strong operating income performance was partially offset by foreign currency translation and increases in interest expense. ​ Balance Sheet ​ We remain committed to maintaining “A” range ratings metrics over the long-term, supported by our current credit ratings of A-/A3/A- by Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s Investor Services and Fitch, respectively. Our strong balance sheet has allowed us continued access to capital at attractive rates. ​ Cash Flow ​ Cash flow from operating activities was $2.4 billion in 2023 compared to $1.8 billion in 2022. We continued to generate strong cash flow from operations, allowing us to fund our ongoing operations, investments in our business, acquisitions, debt repayments, pension obligations and return cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments. ​ Dividends ​ Dividends declared per common share in 2023 was $2.16 per share. In December 2023 we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 8% to $0.57 per share, representing our 32 nd consecutive annual dividend rate increase. We have paid cash dividends on our common shares for 87 consecutive years. Our outstanding dividend history reflects our long-term growth and development, strong cash flows, solid financial position and confidence in our business prospects for the years ahead. ​ ​ 26 [/295]

[1311]: The below tables present the schedule of financial highlights of the Company: [/1311]
[1313]: (1) The per share data was derived by using the weighted average shares outstanding during the applicable period, except for distributions declared and issuance of common stock in connection with the Merger, which reflects the actual amount per share for the applicable period. [/1313]
[1314]: (2) The amount shown may not correspond for the period as it includes the effect of the timing of the distribution and the issuance of common stock. [/1314]
[1315]: (3) Amount rounds to less than $ 0.01 . [/1315]
[1316]: (4) The table above reflects a reclassification between Net realized and unrealized gains (losses) and Issuance of common stock, net of underwriting and offering costs for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to previously reported amounts in order to conform with the methodology used to calculate such amounts for the year ended December 31, 2023. The effect of this reclassification was a change in Net realized and unrealized gains (losses) of $ 0.12 , from $( 1.82 ) to $( 1.70 ), and an offsetting change in Issuance of common stock, net of underwriting and offering costs of $( 0.12 ), from $ 0.13 to $ 0.01 .

[1259]: Unrealized gains and losses associated with changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not accounted for as cash flow hedges are reflected in current period results of operations. [/1259]
[1260]: The following table summarizes the pre-tax effects of economic hedges that have not been designated as cash flow hedges or fair value hedges and trading activity on the Company's statement of operations. The effect of foreign exchange and commodity hedges is included within revenues and cost of operations. The effect of the interest rate contracts are included within interest expense. The effect of the Consumer Financing Program is included in other income, net. [/1260]
[1263]: The reversals of acquired loss/(gain) positions were valued based upon the forward prices on the acquisition date. The roll-off amounts were offset by realized gains or losses at the settled prices and are reflected in revenue or cost of operations during the same period. [/1263]

[578]: Consolidated Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 [/578]
[579]: The following table provides selected financial information for the Company: [/579]
[581]: (a) Includes realized gains and losses from financially settled transactions [/581]
[582]: (b) Includes trading gains and losses and ancillary revenues [/582]
[583]: (c) Includes amortization of SO 2 and NO x credits and excludes amortization of RGGI credits [/583]
[584]: Gross Margin [/584]
[585]: The Company calculates gross margin in order to evaluate operating performance as revenues less cost of fuel, purchased energy and other costs of sales, mark-to-market for economic hedging activities, contract and emission credit amortization and depreciation and amortization. [/585]
[586]: Economic Gross Margin [/586]
[587]: In addition to gross margin, the Company evaluates its operating performance using the measure of economic gross margin, which is not a GAAP measure and may not be comparable to other companies’ presentations or deemed more useful [/587]
[810]: Based on a sensitivity analysis using simplified assumptions, the impact of a $0.50 per MMBtu increase or decrease in natural gas prices across the term of the derivative contracts would result in a change of approximately $2.0 billion in the net value of derivatives as of December 31, 2023. [/810]
[811]: Critical Accounting Estimates [/811]
[812]: The Company's discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges, and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the accounting guidance has not changed. [/812]
[1147]: Table element - Text before table: The derivative liabilities are recorded in connection with the contractual future payment obligations with the financing providers under Vivint Smart Home’s Consumer Financing Program. The fair values of the derivatives liabilities as of the Acquisition Closing Date were valued using a discounted cash flow model, with inputs consisting of available market data, such as market yield discount rates, as well as unobservable internally derived assumptions, such as collateral prepayment rates, collateral default rates and credit loss rates. These derivatives are classified as Level 3 and changes to the fair value are recorded through other income, net in the consolidated statement of operations.

[730]: Determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements express the uncertainties with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any changes in such valuations, on the consolidated financial statements.

[733]: Investments and related investment income. Realized gains or losses on investments are recorded upon the sale or disposition of a portfolio investment and are calculated as the difference between the net proceeds from the sale or disposition and the cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on the consolidated statements of operations includes changes in the fair value of investments from the prior period, as determined by the Board through the application of our valuation policy, as well as reclassifications of any prior period unrealized appreciation or depreciation on exited investments to realized gains or losses on investments. [/733]
[566]: (9) Other expenses represent our estimated annual operating expenses, as a percentage of net assets attributable to common shares estimated for the current year, including professional fees, directors’ fees, insurance costs, expenses of our dividend reinvestment plan and payments under the Administration Agreement based on our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by our administrator. See Item 1. “Business — Management and Other Agreements—Administration Agreement.” Other expenses exclude interest payments on borrowed funds, income tax (provision) benefit from realized gains on investment, income tax (provision) from deemed distribution of long term capital gains, and for issuances of debt securities or preferred stock, interest payments on debt securities and distributions with respect to preferred stock. “Other expenses” are based on actual other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023. [/566]
[567]: (10) “Total annual expenses, before base management fee waiver” as a percentage of consolidated net assets attributable to common stock are higher than the total annual expenses percentage would be for a company that is not leveraged. We borrow money to leverage our net assets and increase our total assets. [/567]

[998]: For the Company’s equity investments, including equity securities and warrants, the Company generally uses a market approach, including valuation methodologies consistent with industry practice, to estimate the enterprise value of portfolio companies. Typically, the enterprise value of a private company is based on multiples of EBITDA, net income, revenues, or in limited cases, book value. In estimating the enterprise value of a portfolio company, the Company analyzes various factors consistent with industry practice, including but not limited to original transaction multiples, the portfolio company’s historical and projected financial results, applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and leverage levels, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, and comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public. [/998]
[999]: The Company may also utilize an income approach when estimating the fair value of its equity investments, either as a primary methodology if consistent with industry practice or if the market approach is otherwise not applicable, or as a supporting methodology to corroborate the fair value ranges determined by the market approach. The Company typically prepares and analyzes discounted cash flow models based on projections of the future free cash flows (or earnings) of the portfolio company. The Company considers various factors, including, but not limited to, the portfolio company’s projected financial results, applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and leverage levels, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, and comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public. [/999]
[788]: Our audit procedures related to the Company’s valuation of level 3 investments included the following, among others: [/788]
[789]: 83 [/789]
[790]: • We evaluated the appropriateness of management’s valuation techniques, such as the discounted cash flow or enterprise value, and management’s asset coverage analysis. We also evaluated whether assumptions used by management, including revenue, EBITDA, or asset coverage multiples, and discount rates, were reasonable by comparing and calibrating these inputs to purchase data and market information obtained from external sources while considering portfolio company specific factors like performance. For a selection of investments, we utilized valuation specialists to perform this evaluation. [/790]
[791]: • For a select number of investments, we developed an independent fair value estimate which was compared to management’s estimate. [/791]
[792]: • We evaluated the Company’s historical ability to estimate fair value by comparing the fair value as estimated by management against sale transactions, taking into consideration changes in market or investment specific factors, where applicable and available. [/792]
[714]: Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates [/714]
[715]: The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions affecting amounts reported in the financial statements. We have identified investment valuation, revenue recognition, and transfers of financial assets as our most critical accounting policies and estimates. We continuously evaluate our policies and estimates, including those related to the matters described below. These estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A discussion of our critical accounting policies follows. [/715]
[716]: Valuation of Portfolio Investments [/716]
[717]: As a BDC, we report our assets and liabilities at fair value at all times consistent with GAAP and the 1940 Act. Accordingly, we are required to periodically determine the fair value of all of our portfolio investments. [/717]

[950]: Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies Basis of presentation: The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-K, Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 946, Financial Services – Investment Companies (“ASC 946”), and Articles 6 and 10 of Regulation S-X. In the opinion of management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments and reclassifications that are necessary for the fair presentation of financial results as of and for the periods presented. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. During fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, the Company elected to change the manner in which it presents residual investments in portfolio companies that have sold their operations and are in the process of winding down. These investments similar to escrow receivables are now included in prepaid expenses and other assets whereas previously they were included as a component of investments, at fair value, on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities until the security was legally extinguished or relinquished. There is no change in historical net increase in net assets resulting from operations due to this change in presentation. Use of estimates: The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Consolidation: Pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation S-X and ASC 946, the Company will generally not consolidate its investments in a company other than an investment company subsidiary or a controlled operating company whose business consists of providing services to the Company. As a result, the consolidated financial statements of the Company include only the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries"
