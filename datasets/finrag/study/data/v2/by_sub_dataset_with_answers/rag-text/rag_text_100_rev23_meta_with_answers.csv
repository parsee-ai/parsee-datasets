Contract assets increased $ 865 million during 2023, primarily due to the recognition of revenue related to the satisfaction or partial satisfaction of performance obligations during 2023 for which we have not yet billed our customers (primarily on the F-35 program at Aeronautics). There were no significant credit or impairment losses related to our contract assets during 2023 and 2022. We expect to bill our customers for the majority of the December 31, 2023 contract assets during 2024. [/799]

[765]: Table element - Text before table: Our allowance for credit losses reflects our estimate of the amount of our receivables that we will be unable to collect based on historical write-off experience and, as applicable, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect collectibility. Our estimate could require change based on changing circumstances, including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers. Accordingly, we may be required to increase or decrease our allowance. Trade receivables that have contractual maturities of one year or less are written-off when they are determined to be uncollectible based on the criteria necessary to qualify as a deduction for federal tax purposes. Write-offs of such receivables require management approval based on specified dollar thresholds. See the table below for a rollforward of our allowance for credit losses.
The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information from past events, including historical experiences, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect collectibility. Trade receivables are the only material financial asset we have that is subject to the requirement to measure expected credit losses as noted above, as this requirement does not apply to receivables arising from operating lease revenues. Substantially all of our non-lease trade receivables are due in one year or less. As discussed above, most of our equipment rental revenue is accounted for as lease revenue (such revenue represented 76 percent of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023), and these revenues account for corresponding portions of the $ 2.230 billion of net accounts receivable and the associated allowance for credit losses of $ 169 as of December 31, 2023.
As discussed above, most of our equipment rental revenue is accounted for under Topic 842. The customers that are responsible for the remaining revenue that is accounted for under Topic 606 are generally the same customers that rent our equipment. We manage credit risk associated with our accounts receivables at the customer level.

[561]: Table element - Text before table: 2023 operating income decreased $1.6 billion and operating margin rate decreased to (4.4) percent primarily due to the previously described $1.56 billion charge recorded on the LRIP phase of the B-21 program, inclusive of a $143 million unfavorable EAC adjustment for the first LRIP lot. The prior year period includes $133 million of favorable EAC adjustments on the engineering, manufacturing and development phase of the B-21 program and a $38 million gain on a property sale. Apart from the B-21 EAC adjustments noted above, net EAC adjustments across the sector were $58 million higher than in the prior year.

Skilled Mix — Like most skilled nursing providers, we measure both patient days and revenue by payor. Medicare, managed care and other skilled patients, whom we refer to as high acuity patients, typically require a higher level of skilled nursing and rehabilitative care. Accordingly, Medicare and managed care reimbursement rates are typically higher than from other payors. In most states, Medicaid reimbursement rates are generally the lowest of all payor types.

The key information to answer the question is found in text fragments [86] and [428], which both show a table with GE's revenues for 2023. Fragment [86] shows total revenues of $67,954 million, while fragment [428] breaks this down into equipment sales of $26,793 million, services sales of $37,772 million, and insurance revenues of $3,389 million, totaling $67,954 million.

The relevant table in this fragment shows the revenues for the years 2023, 2022, and 2021. To find the revenues for the 12 month period ending December 2023, we need to look at the first column of the table, which is labeled ""REVENUES"" and has the value ""$ 67,954"" for the year 2023.

Therefore, the revenues for the 12 month period ending December 2023 are $67,954.

The currency for this value is USD, as indicated in the table header of text fragment [86].

The unit for this value is none, as there is no specific unit mentioned in the table header of text fragment [86].

Management believes the presentation of adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share provides investors with greater transparency and provides a more complete understanding of the Company’s financial performance and prospects for the future by excluding items that management believes are non-operating in nature and not representative of the Company’s core operating performance. In addition, management believes the adjustments shown below are useful to investors in order to allow them to compare the Company’s financial results for the current periods presented with the prior periods presented.

We determine operating segments based on how our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) manages the business, makes operating decisions around the allocation of resources, and evaluates operating performance. Our CODM is our Chief Executive Officer, who regularly reviews our operating results on a consolidated basis. We operate as one segment and have one reportable segment. Based on the information provided to and reviewed by our CODM, we believe that the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows and how they are affected by economic factors are most appropriately depicted through our primary geographical markets and types of revenue categories (transaction revenues and revenues from other value added services). Revenues recorded within these categories are earned from similar products and services for which the nature of associated fees and the related revenue recognition models are substantially similar.

[543]: Table element - Text before table: ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”) defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three levels: Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities as well as certain U.S. Treasury securities that are highly liquid and are actively traded in secondary markets; Level 2 – observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted in active markets, but corroborated by market data; and Level 3 – unobservable inputs that are used when little or no market data is available.  The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs and the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs. In determining fair value, we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible as well as consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment of fair value.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued Income Taxes – We operate in a manner intended to enable us to continue to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 – 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”).  In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code, we must distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to stockholders each year. We distribute to our stockholders 100 % of our taxable income and therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required. Dividends distributed for the year ended December 31, 2023 were characterized, for federal income tax purposes, as 41.5 % ordinary income and 58.5 % of long-term capital gain income.  Dividends distributed for the year ended December 31, 2022 were characterized, for federal income tax purposes, as 100 % ordinary income. Dividends distributed for the year ended December 31, 2021 were characterized, for federal income tax purposes, as 58.3 % ordinary income and 41.7 % of long-term capital gain income. The estimated taxable income attributable to our common stockholders (unaudited) for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was approximately $ 98,555,000 , $ 64,960,000 , and $ 101,184,000 , respectively. The book to tax differences between net income and estimated taxable income primarily result from differences in the income recognition or deductibility of depreciation and amortization, gains or losses from the sale of real estate and other capital transactions, straight-line rent adjustments, the change in fair value of marketable securities and income from discontinued operations. As of Dec ember 31, 2023, the net basis of our assets and liabilities for tax reporting purposes was approximately $ 145,246,000 low er than the amount reported for financial statement purposes.

We have been able to offset most of these negative impacts through pricing actions and productivity savings, which we continue to pursue. Future impacts on our business and financial results as a result of these conditions are not estimable at this time, and depend, in part, on the extent to which these conditions improve or worsen, which remains uncertain.

[406]: MT revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $83.8 primarily driven by higher sales volume and pricing actions. Our Friction business grew 6% due to strong OEM demand. Additionally, our KONI and Axtone businesses grew 6% and 10%, respectively. These increases were partially offset by a decline in our Wolverine business of 7%, which was primarily attributable to a decline in sales of sealing materials. The current year period also benefited from favorable foreign currency translation of $17.0. Excluding the impact from foreign currency translation, organic revenue increased $66.8. [/406]
[407]: In March 2023, our Friction business signed a new 10-year agreement, effective January 1, 2024, for the supply of ITT aftermarket brake pads to Continental AG. The previous 10-year agreement with Continental AG expired on December 31, 2023. The new agreement is expected to generate over $1 billion in revenue over its term. [/407]
[369]: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY [/369]
[370]: During 2023, despite evolving macroeconomic conditions, we delivered strong financial results, which included revenue and operating income growth, operating margin expansion, EPS growth and effective deployment of capital. The following table provides a summary of key performance indicators for 2023 in comparison to 2022. [/370]
[372]: See the section titled "" Key Performance Indicators and Non-GAAP Measures "" for a definition and reconciliation of organic revenue, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, and adjusted EPS. [/372]
[373]: Our 2023 results include: [/373]
[374]: • Revenue of $3,283.0 increased $295.3 due to higher sales volume and pricing actions, particularly within IP's aftermarket business, MT's Friction OE business, and CCT's components business. In addition, our 2023 results benefited by $30.5 from our recent acquisitions of Habonim and Micro-Mode Products, Inc. (""Micro-Mode""), and by $23.1 from favorable foreign currency translation. [/374]
[375]: • Operating income of $528.2 increased $60.2, primarily due to higher revenue, productivity savings, a gain of $7.2 on the sale of a product line within our CCT segment, lower charges related to the suspension of business in Russia, and the accretive impact of our recent acquisitions of Habonim and Micro-Mode. The increase in operating income was partially offset by higher labor, raw material and overhead costs, unfavorable foreign currency impacts and product mix, a loss of $15.3 on the sale of our Matrix Composites, Inc. (""Matrix"") business, and a prior year gain of $15.5 on the sale of facilities within our IP segment. [/375]
[422]: Sales and marketing expenses increased $17.1 for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily driven by higher personnel and other sales-related costs to support higher sales activity. The increase in personnel costs was partially attributable to higher headcount stemming from, and timing of, our recent Habonim and Micro-Mode acquisitions. [/422]

[763]: Table element - Text before table: Business Combinations In October 2021, the FASB issued amended guidance on accounting for contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers in a business combination. The guidance is intended to address inconsistency related to recognition of an acquired contract liability and payment terms and their effect on subsequent revenue recognized. At the acquisition date, an entity should account for the related revenue contracts in accordance with existing revenue recognition guidance generally by assessing how the acquiree applied recognition and measurement in their financial statements. The guidance was adopted on January 1, 2023 and the adoption did not have an impact to the consolidated financial statements. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted Income Taxes In December 2023, the FASB issued amended guidance on income tax disclosures. The guidance is intended to provide additional disaggregation to the effective income tax rate reconciliation and income tax payment disclosures. The amended guidance is effective for annual periods beginning January 2025 and should be applied on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. Segment Reporting In November 2023, the FASB issued amended guidance for improvements to reportable segment disclosures. The revised guidance requires that a public entity disclose significant segment expenses regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (CODM), including public entities with a single reportable segment. The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning January 2024 and interim periods beginning January 2025 on a retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted.

[1057]: Table element - Text before table: MSUs are granted to executive officers. Vesting is conditioned upon continuous employment and occurs ratably over four years , subject to accelerated vesting in specified circumstances. The number of shares issued upon vesting of MSUs is determined based on a specified payout factor requiring that the market price per share at a specified measurement date be at least 80 % of the grant-date share price (market condition) for awards granted in 2023 ( 60 % prior to 2022). Attainment of a higher payout factor, calculated as the share price on measurement date divided by share price on award date, results in a higher percentage payout of MSUs, up to a maximum of 225 % of the target number of MSUs for awards granted in 2023 ( 200 % prior to 2022). The share price used in the payout factor is calculated using an average of the closing prices on the grant date or measurement date, and the nine trading days immediately preceding the grant date or measurement date.
PSUs are granted to executive officers, have a three-year performance cycle and are granted as a target number of stock units subject to adjustment. The number of shares issued when PSUs vest is determined based on the achievement of specified performance goals (a performance condition) and based on BMS’s three-year relative total shareholder return compound annual growth rate relative to a peer group of companies (a market condition) for awards granted in 2023 ( three-year total shareholder return relative to a peer group of companies prior to 2023) and can range from 0 % to a maximum of 200 % of the target number of PSUs. Vesting is conditioned upon continuous employment and occurs on the third anniversary of the grant date, subject to accelerated vesting in specified circumstances.
Stock-based compensation expense for awards ultimately expected to vest is recognized over the vesting period. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.

RayzeBio is a clinical-stage radiopharmaceutical therapeutics company with an innovation-leading position in actinium-based radiopharmaceutical therapeutics and a pipeline of potentially first-in-class and best-in-class drug development programs. Refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 4. Acquisitions, Divestitures, Licensing and Other Arrangements” for additional information. The goal of the collaboration with SystImmune is to co-develop and co-commercialize BL-B01D1, a bispecific topoisomerase inhibitor-based anti-body drug conjugate which targets both EGFR and HER3 and is currently being evaluated in a Phase I clinical trial for metastatic or unresectable NSCLC. Refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 3. Alliances” for further information.
The Company has the potential to increase its registrational portfolio from six to up to twelve potentially first-in-class/best-in-class assets. In addition to its growing registrational portfolio, the Company has more than 25 indication expansion opportunities on the horizon. Taken together, this leads to increased depth across the Company’s therapeutic areas, including oncology, hematology, immunology, cardiovascular and a growing presence in neuroscience.

[536]: Table element - Text before table: Our non-U.S. businesses have significantly more direct customers. Information on available direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information varies widely. We limit our direct customer sales channel inventory reporting to where we can influence demand. When this information does not exist or is otherwise not available, we have developed a variety of methodologies to estimate such data, including using historical sales made to direct customers and third-party market research data related to prescription trends and end-user demand. Given the difficulties inherent in estimating third-party demand information, we evaluate our methodologies to estimate direct customer product level inventory and to calculate months on hand on an ongoing basis and make changes as necessary. Factors that may affect our estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, price increases, new product launches, new warehouse openings by direct customers, new customer stockings by direct customers and expected direct customer purchases for governmental bidding situations. As such, all of the information required to estimate months on hand in the direct customer distribution channel for non-U.S. business for the year ended December 31, 2023 is not available prior to the filing of this 2023 Form 10-K. We will disclose any product with levels of inventory in excess of one month on hand or expected demand for the current quarter, subject to certain limited exceptions, in our next quarterly report on Form 10-Q.

[56]: Table element - Text before table: We operate in one segment engaged in the discovery, development, licensing, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sale of biopharmaceutical products on a global basis. We expect that our planned acquisitions of Karuna and RayzeBio, announced during the fourth quarter of 2023, as well as the Mirati (2024) and the Turning Point (2022) acquisitions, will continue to position us as a leading biopharmaceutical company, expanding our targeted oncology portfolio, as well as other therapeutic areas, including neuroscience. Our principal strategy is to combine the resources, scale and capability of a pharmaceutical company with the speed and focus on innovation of the biotech industry. Our focus as a biopharmaceutical company is on discovering, developing and delivering transformational medicines for patients facing serious diseases in areas where we believe that we have an opportunity to make a meaningful difference: oncology, hematology, immunology, cardiovascular and neuroscience. Our priorities are to continue renewing and diversifying our portfolio, advancing our early, mid and late-stage pipeline, and executing disciplined business development. We remain committed to strengthening our balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders. For a further discussion of our strategy initiatives, refer to “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Strategy.”
We compete with other worldwide research-based drug companies, smaller research companies and generic drug manufacturers. Our products are sold worldwide, primarily to wholesalers, distributors, specialty pharmacies, and to a lesser extent, directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics and government agencies. We have significant manufacturing operations in the U.S., Puerto Rico, Switzerland, Ireland, and the Netherlands. Most of our revenues come from products in the following therapeutic classes: hematology, oncology, cardiovascular and immunology.

[620]: Table element - Text before table: Currency-neutral growth rates are calculated by remeasuring the prior period’s results using the current period’s exchange rates for both the translational and transactional impacts on operating results and are non-GAAP financial measures.  The impact of currency translation represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different than our U.S. dollar reporting currency.  The impact of the transactional currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expenses occurring in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity.  The impact of the related realized gains and losses resulting from our foreign exchange derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments is recognized in the respective financial statement line item on the statement of operations when the underlying forecasted transactions impact earnings.  We believe the presentation of currency-neutral growth rates provides relevant information to facilitate an understanding of our operating results.
The translational and transactional impact of currency and the related impact of our foreign exchange derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments (“Currency impact”) has been excluded from our currency-neutral growth rates and has been identified in the non-GAAP information below and our “Drivers of Change” tables.

(currency): What is the currency  possible values (select one from json array): ['USD', 'EUR', 'Other']
(unit): What is the unit?  possible values (select one from json array): ['none', 'thousands', 'millions', 'billions'] 

                    
                     


                    Your answer should be formatted as a JSON object. Under the key 'answers' can be one or more JSON object(s), with key value pairs for the main question and the meta items. For the main question use the key 'main_question', for the meta items use their ID as key. Under the key 'sources', you should also provide the numbers of the text fragments you used to answer the question. For example your answer could look like this: {""answers"": [{""main_question"": ""123"", ""currency"": ""USD"", ""unit"": ""none""}], ""sources"": [241, 423]}

A limitation of the adjusted net income and adjusted EPS measures is that they provide a view of our operations without including all events during a period, such as the effects of an acquisition or amortization of purchased intangibles, and do not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies. The adjusted net income and adjusted EPS measures are not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for U.S. GAAP reported net income attributable to Zoetis and reported EPS.

Our research and development (R&D) efforts enable us to deliver innovative products to address unmet needs and evolve our product lines so that they remain relevant for our customers.
We have approximately 300 product lines that we sell in over 100 countries for the prediction, prevention, detection and treatment of diseases and conditions that affect various companion animal and livestock species. The diversity of our product portfolio and our global operations provides stability to our overall business. For instance, in livestock, impacts on our revenue that may result from disease outbreaks or weather conditions in a particular market or region are often offset by increased sales in other regions from exports and other species as consumers shift to other animal proteins.

These favorable effects were partially offset by incremental expenses related to continued investment in products, innovation and our technology environments. In addition, the inclusion of EVO had an unfavorable effect on the Merchant Solutions operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the prior year. [/533]

Restricted cash includes amounts that cannot be withdrawn or used for general operating activities under legal or regulatory restrictions. Restricted cash consists of amounts deposited by customers for prepaid card transactions and funds held as a liquidity reserve that are subject to local regulatory restrictions requiring appropriate segregation and restriction in their use. Restricted cash is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding liability in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. We regularly maintain cash balances with financial institutions in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit or the equivalent outside the U.S. As of December 31, 2023 , approximately 75 % of our total balance of cash and cash equivalents was held within a small group of financial institutions, primarily large money center banks. Although we currently believe that the financial institutions with whom we do business will be able to fulfill their commitments to us, there is no assurance that those institutions will be able to continue to do so. We have not experienced any losses associated with our balances in such accounts for the year ended December 31, 2023, 2022 or 2021 .

[425]: Table element - Text before table: Cost of maintenance and support. Cost of maintenance and support decreased due to lower personnel costs as our maintenance customer base declined primarily with migrations to our subscription solutions. Maintenance and support gross profit percentages for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, were 61% and 72%, respectively. Gross profit percentages decreased in 2023 as compared to prior year primarily due to lower maintenance and support revenue an d the cost of maintenance and support being relatively fixed.
Cost of services. Cost of services increased primarily due to higher personnel costs to support the increase in our services revenue during the period. Services gross profit percentages for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, were (1)% and (8)%, respectively. Services gross profit percentages improved in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to an increase in services revenue and a lesser increase in cost of services due to greater efficiencies.

[690]: Table element - Text before table: During 2021, the Company could transfer up to $ 200 million of certain receivables. During 2022, the program was amended to increase the transfer limit up to $ 350 million of certain receivables.
At December 31, 2023, and 2022 the bankruptcy-remote subsidiary held receivables of $ 674 million and $ 458 million, respectively, which are included in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The receivables held by the bankruptcy-remote subsidiary collateralize the outstanding receivables sold, which was $ 20 million and $ 80 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The transfers are recorded at the fair value of the proceeds received and obligations assumed less derecognized receivables. No obligation was recorded at December 31, 2023 or 2022 as the estimated expected credit losses on receivables sold is insignificant. Our maximum exposure to loss related to these receivables transferred is limited to the amount outstanding.

Answer: {""answers"": [{""main_question"": 9237064, ""currency"": ""USD"", ""unit"": ""thousands""}], ""sources"": [994]}","You are supposed to answer a question based on text fragments that are provided. The fragments start with a number in square brackets and then the actual text. The end of the fragment is shown by the same number in square brackets, only that the number is preceded by a slash. E.g. [22] Some Text [/22]. The lower the number of the fragment, the earlier the fragment appeared in the document (reading from left to right, top to bottom).  


                    The question is: What are the revenues for the 12 month period ending december 2023?  possible values: any number (positive or negative, including decimals)
 We also want to retrieve some meta information. In the following we will present the meta item ID and then the additional question to be answered, format: (META_ID): QUESTION.
(currency): What is the currency  possible values (select one from json array): ['USD', 'EUR', 'Other']
(unit): What is the unit?  possible values (select one from json array): ['none', 'thousands', 'millions', 'billions'] 

                    
                     


                    Your answer should be formatted as a JSON object. Under the key 'answers' can be one or more JSON object(s), with key value pairs for the main question and the meta items. For the main question use the key 'main_question', for the meta items use their ID as key. Under the key 'sources', you should also provide the numbers of the text fragments you used to answer the question. For example your answer could look like this: {""answers"": [{""main_question"": ""123"", ""currency"": ""USD"", ""unit"": ""none""}], ""sources"": [241, 423]}

[679]: Telephony revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $300,198 and $332,406, respectively.  Telephony revenue is derived principally through monthly charges to residential customers of our telephony services. Telephony revenue decreased $32,208 (10%) for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was due to a decline in telephony customers, partially offset by higher average recurring revenue per telephony customer. [/679]

in accordance with ASC 606. The amount of revenue that the Company recognizes reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange
for goods or services and such revenue is recognized at the time when goods or services are transferred and/or delivered to its customers.
Revenue is recognized when the Company satisfies a performance obligation by transferring the product or service to the customer, either
at a point in time or over time. The Company usually recognizes revenue from integration service agreements and from manufacturing licenses
at a point in time unless the agreements provide for customer acceptance in which case revenue is recognized over time. Revenue from integration
license agreements and from MSTcad licenses are recognized over a period of time.

(in thousands): [/365]
[367]: Unbilled contracts receivable and deferred revenue : [/367]
[368]: Timing of revenue recognition
may differ from the timing of invoicing customers. Accounts receivable includes amounts billed and currently due from customers. Unbilled
contracts receivable represents unbilled amounts expected to be received from customers in future periods, where the revenue recognized
to date exceeds the amount billed, and the right to receive payment is subject to the underlying contractual terms. Unbilled contracts
receivable amounts may not exceed their net realizable value and are classified as long-term assets if the payments are expected to be
received more than one year from the reporting date. [/368]
[370]: Basic net loss per share is
calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net loss per share is
computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the sum of the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding and the dilutive common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period. The Company’s potentially dilutive common
stock equivalent shares, which include incremental common shares issuable upon (i) the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants
and (ii) vesting of restricted stock units and restricted stock awards, are only included in the calculation of diluted net loss per share
when their effect is dilutive. Since the Company has had net losses for all periods presented, all potentially dilutive securities are
anti-dilutive. Accordingly, basic and diluted net loss per share are equal. [/370]

[318]: Based on the funds it has
available as of the date of the filing of this report, the Company believes that it has sufficient capital to fund its current business
plans and obligations over, at least, 12 months from the date that these financial statements have been issued. The Company’s future
capital requirements and the adequacy of its available funds will depend on many factors, including the Company’s ability to successfully
commercialize its technology, competing technological and market developments, and the need to enter into collaborations with other companies
or acquire technologies to enhance or complement its current offerings. The Company’s operating plans for the next 12 months include
increased research and development expenses. [/318]
[320]: Basis of Presentation [/320]
[321]: The financial statements are
presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and reflect
the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for all periods presented. [/321]
[239]: Interest income. Interest
income for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was approximately $723,000 and $340,000, respectively. Interest income for each
period related to interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and the increase was primarily due to progressively higher interest
rates during these periods. [/239]
[240]: Accretion income. Accretion income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was approximately $283,000. Accretion income relates to the increase in value of
our available-for-sale securities from the purchase date through the maturity date. There was no income from accretion for the year ended
December 31, 2022 because our active cash management program, which involves investment of a portion of our cash in short-term fixed-income
securities commenced in the first quarter of 2023. [/240]
[241]: Other income/expense,
net. Other income for the year December 31, 2023 of approximately $75,000, consisted primarily of a refundable state research
and development tax credit, net of filing costs and tax consulting services. There was no other income/expenses for the year ended December
31, 2022. [/241]

[762]: Table element - Text before table: The fair value of the PSUs is principally based on the fair market value of the Company’s stock at the grant date. The number of underlying shares to be issued will be based on actual performance achievement over the performance period. The accrual of compensation costs is based on our estimate of the probable expected value of the award. The fair value of each PSU grant is amortized monthly into compensation expense on a straight-line basis over a vesting period of 36 months. Changes in expected probable value are recorded as compensation expense on a catch-up basis in the month in which the change is identified. Any remaining balance is amortized monthly into compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining vesting period. The Company assumes that forfeitures will be minimal, and estimates forfeitures at time of issuance, which results in a reduction in compensation expense. As the payout of PSUs includes dividend equivalents, no separate dividend yield assumption is required in calculating the fair value of the PSUs. The Company initiated a dividend during the fourth quarter of 2021.
As of December 31, 2023, there was approximately $ 3.3 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested PSUs granted under the Equity Plan which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.1 years.

Sales decreased in 2023 compared to 2022 by $412.0 million (approximately 21%) due to (i) net unfavorable market-based pricing (approximately 17%) primarily reflecting reduced ammonium sulfate pricing amid lower raw material input costs and a more stable global nitrogen fertilizer supply environment, as well as lower nylon pricing due to unfavorable supply and demand conditions and (ii) unfavorable raw material pass-through pricing (approximately 5%) as a result of a net cost decrease in benzene and propylene (inputs to cumene which is a key feedstock to our products). This was partially offset by the acquisition of U.S. Amines (approximately 1%).

We also use foreign currency forward contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities. As a result of foreign currency fluctuations, the U.S. Dollar equivalent values of our foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities change. Gains and losses on these contracts are included in other income (expense), on a net basis, along with the foreign currency gains and losses of the related foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities associated with these foreign currency forward contracts.

Cross-currency Interest Rate Swaps. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we elected to de-designate a portion of our cross-currency interest rate swaps previously designated as net investment hedges. Gains and losses subsequent to the de-designation will be recognized in earnings to offset remeasurement gains and losses from foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities. We also entered into $ 283.4 million of cross-currency interest rate swaps, which were not designated as hedging instruments.

[383]: Table element - Text before table: Adjusted Gross Profit . Adjusted Gross Profit increased to $732 million (21.5% of sales) for 2023 from $715 million (21.3% of sales) for 2022, an increase of $17 million. The increase was primarily due to improved margins on gas products and valves, automation, measurement and instrumentation sales, along with specific high-margin line pipe sales. Adjusted Gross Profit is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted Gross Profit as sales, less cost of sales, plus depreciation and amortization, plus amortization of intangibles, plus inventory-related charges incremental to normal operations and plus or minus the impact of our LIFO inventory costing methodology. We present Adjusted Gross Profit because we believe it is a useful indicator of our operating performance without regard to items, such as amortization of intangibles that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon the nature and extent of acquisitions. Similarly, the impact of the LIFO inventory costing method can cause results to vary substantially from company to company depending upon whether they elect to utilize LIFO and depending upon which method they may elect. We use Adjusted Gross Profit as a key performance indicator in managing our business. We believe that gross profit is the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles that is most directly comparable to Adjusted Gross Profit.

[297]: Risks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital [/297]
[298]: ​ [/298]
[299]: We have a history of significant operating losses and expect to incur significant and increasing losses for the foreseeable future , and we may never achieve or maintain profitability . [/299]
[300]: ​ [/300]
[301]: We do not expect to generate revenue or profitability that is necessary to finance our operations in the short term.  Since inception, we have incurred recurring losses, including net losses of $180.7 million, $112.7 million and $66.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $511.8 million. To date, we have not commercialized any products or generated any revenues from the sale of products, and absent the realization of sufficient revenues from product sales, we may never attain profitability in the future.  We have devoted substantially all of our financial resources and efforts to research and development, including preclinical studies and our clinical trials.  Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. Net losses and negative cash flows have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our shareholders’ equity and working capital. [/301]

Explanation:
The total operating revenues for the 12 month period ending December 2023 are $3,589 million. The currency used is USD, and the unit is millions. The source for this information is fragment [961].","You are supposed to answer a question based on text fragments that are provided. The fragments start with a number in square brackets and then the actual text. The end of the fragment is shown by the same number in square brackets, only that the number is preceded by a slash. E.g. [22] Some Text [/22]. The lower the number of the fragment, the earlier the fragment appeared in the document (reading from left to right, top to bottom).  


                    The question is: What are the revenues for the 12 month period ending december 2023?  possible values: any number (positive or negative, including decimals)
 We also want to retrieve some meta information. In the following we will present the meta item ID and then the additional question to be answered, format: (META_ID): QUESTION.
(currency): What is the currency  possible values (select one from json array): ['USD', 'EUR', 'Other']
(unit): What is the unit?  possible values (select one from json array): ['none', 'thousands', 'millions', 'billions'] 

                    
                     


                    Your answer should be formatted as a JSON object. Under the key 'answers' can be one or more JSON object(s), with key value pairs for the main question and the meta items. For the main question use the key 'main_question', for the meta items use their ID as key. Under the key 'sources', you should also provide the numbers of the text fragments you used to answer the question. For example your answer could look like this: {""answers"": [{""main_question"": ""123"", ""currency"": ""USD"", ""unit"": ""none""}], ""sources"": [241, 423]}

[725]: Table element - Text before table: Other Income (Expense). Other income (expense) was $35 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to no other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2022. Higher interest rates and increased balances in our interest-bearing cash accounts contributed to an increase in interest income. Additionally, higher interest rates and the increase in PDP balances contributed to greater capitalized interest. Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 due to increased rates and balances as compared to the prior period and interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was unfavorably impacted by a $7 million non-cash charge from the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the repayment of the Treasury Loan.
Income Taxes. Our income tax expense was $43 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to an $8 million benefit for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 134.4%, primarily due to a $37 million valuation allowance recorded in December 2023 against our U.S. federal and state net operating loss deferred tax assets, which expire from one year to having no expiration, as a result of being in a three-year cumulative pre-tax loss position and limitations on compensation provided to certain executives pursuant to Internal Revenue Code section 162(m), partially offset by benefits recognized on the exercise of expiring stock options. Please refer to “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—15. Income Taxes” for additional information.

[758]: Income Statement Impact of Derivative Instruments [/758]
[759]: The effect of derivative instruments on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was as follows: [/759]
[761]: (a) Gains (losses) recognized in income for non-designated commodities futures and options contracts were included in cost of sales.  Gains (losses) recognized in income for non-designated foreign currency forward exchange contracts and deferred compensation derivatives were included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses. [/761]
[762]: (b) Gains (losses) reclassified from AOCI into income for foreign currency forward exchange contracts were included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses.  Losses reclassified from AOCI into income for interest rate swap agreements were included in interest expense. [/762]
[763]: The amount of pretax net losses on derivative instruments, including interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency forward exchange contracts expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months was approximately $ 9,659 as of December 31, 2023.  This amount is primarily associated with interest rate swap agreements. [/763]
[673]: Table element - Text before table: required.  For those reporting units tested using a quantitative approach, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill.  If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, impairment is indicated, requiring recognition of a goodwill impairment charge for the differential (up to the carrying value of goodwill).  We test individual indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the estimated fair values with the book values of each asset. We determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets using an income approach.  Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows.  Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate the future cash flows used to measure fair value.  Our estimates of future cash flows consider past performance, current and anticipated market conditions and internal projections and operating plans which incorporate estimates for sales growth and profitability, and cash flows associated with taxes and capital spending.  Additional assumptions include forecasted growth rates, estimated discount rates, which may be risk-adjusted for the operating market of the reporting unit, and estimated royalty rates that would be charged for comparable branded licenses.  We believe such assumptions also reflect current and anticipated market conditions and are consistent with those that would be used by other marketplace participants for similar valuation purposes. Such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions. The cost of intangible assets with finite useful lives is amortized on a straight-line basis.  Our finite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of certain trademarks, customer-related intangible assets and patents obtained through business acquisitions. The weighted-average amortization period for our finite-lived intangible assets is approximately 28 years, which is primarily driven by recently acquired trademarks.  If certain events or changes in operating conditions indicate that the carrying value of these assets, or related asset groups, may not be recoverable, we perform an impairment assessment and may adjust the remaining useful lives.  See Note 3 for additional information regarding the results of impairment tests.
Supplier Finance Program Obligations
During 2020, we entered into an agreement with two third-party financial institutions to facilitate a supplier finance program which allows qualifying suppliers to sell their receivables from the Company to the financial institution. These participating suppliers negotiate their outstanding receivable arrangements directly with the financial institution, and our rights and obligations to our suppliers are not impacted.  We have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to enter into these agreements.  Once a qualifying supplier elects to participate in the supplier finance program and reaches an agreement with a financial institution, they elect which individual Company invoices they sell to the financial institution.  However, all Company payments to participating suppliers are paid to the financial institution on the invoice due date, regardless of whether the individual invoice is sold by the supplier to the financial institution.  The financial institution pays the supplier on the invoice due date for any invoices that were not previously sold under the supplier finance program.  Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted by our suppliers’ decisions to sell amounts under these arrangements.  The payment of these obligations is included in cash provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The rollforward of the Company’s outstanding obligations confirmed as valid under its supplier finance program, which are included in Accounts Payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, for year ended December 31, 2023 are as follows:; table: (row 0)

[362]: Operating profit was $2,560.9 million in 2023 compared to $2,260.8 million in 2022, an increase of $300.1 million, or 13.3%.  The increase was predominantly due to higher gross profit, partially offset by higher SM&A expenses, as noted above.  Operating profit margin increased to 22.9% in 2023 from 21.7% in 2022 by the same factors noted above in gross margin. [/362]
[363]: 2022 compared with 2021 [/363]
[364]: Operating profit was $2,260.8 million in 2022 compared to $2,043.7 million in 2021, an increase of $217.1 million, or 10.6%.  The increase was predominantly due to higher gross profit, partially offset by higher SM&A expenses, as noted above.  Operating profit margin decreased to 21.7% in 2022 from 22.8% in 2021 driven by these same factors. [/364]
[365]: Interest Expense, Net [/365]
[366]: 2023 compared with 2022 [/366]
[367]: Net interest expense was $151.8 million in 2023 compared to $137.6 million in 2022, an increase of $14.2 million, or 10.3%.  The increase was primarily due to higher rates on short-term debt balances in 2023 versus 2022, specifically related to outstanding commercial paper borrowings, and higher rates on long-term debt balances, specifically related to the $350 million 4.25% Notes and $400 million 4.50% Notes issued in May 2023.  The increase in the expense was partially offset by an increase in interest income. [/367]

[433]: The following table is derived from our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: [/433]
[435]: Operating activities [/435]
[436]: Our principal source of liquidity is cash flow from operations.  Our net income and, consequently, our cash provided by operations are impacted by sales volume, seasonal sales patterns, timing of new product introductions, profit margins and price changes.  Sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns.  Generally, working capital needs peak during the summer months.  We meet these needs primarily with cash on hand, bank borrowings or the issuance of commercial paper. [/436]
[437]: We generated cash of $2.32 billion from operating activities in 2023, a decrease of $4.6 million compared to $2.33 billion in 2022.  The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was mainly driven by the following factors: [/437]
[438]: • In the aggregate, select net working capital items, specifically, trade accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, consumed cash of $209.0 million in 2023, compared to $8.6 million in 2022.  This $200.4 million fluctuation was mainly driven by mainly driven by an increase in cash used by accounts receivable due to an increase in sales of U.S. seasonal products and the timing of vendor and supplier payments.

[498]: Table element - Text before table: This section also includes a discussion of constant currency results, which we use for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons by excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on the reported results. Constant currency is a non-GAAP measure. All constant currency results presented in this Item 7 exclude the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on the reported results. To present this information, the 2023 results for entities whose functional currency is a currency other than the U.S. Dollar were converted to U.S. Dollars at rates that were in effect for the 2022 comparable period, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect for 2023. Constant currency growth rates are calculated by adjusting the 2023 reported amounts by the 2023 currency fluctuation impacts and comparing to the 2022 comparable period reported amounts.
Impact of Foreign Currency
Our comparative financial results were impacted by fluctuations in the U.S. Dollar during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The impacts on our revenue and operating income as a result of the fluctuations of the U.S. Dollar when measured against our foreign currencies based on 2022 exchange rates are reflected in the table below.

[217]: Table element - Text before table: Our business has experienced seasonality, including quarterly volatility in software sales driven primarily by the timing of customer renewal cycles.

Subscription lease and maintenance contract renewals, as well as our revenue, are typically highest in the fourth quarter.
DEFERRED REVENUE AND BACKLOG
Deferred revenue consists of billings made or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from customer agreements. The deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets does not represent the total value of annual or multi-year, noncancellable agreements. Our backlog represents deferred revenue associated with installment billings for periods beyond the current quarterly billing cycle and committed contracts with start dates beyond the end of the current period.

[752]: Table element - Text before table: adjustments to the fixed fee for inflation.  The SPAs and contracted volumes to be made available under the SPAs are not tied to a specific Train; however, the term of each SPA generally commences upon the date of first commercial delivery of a specified Train.  Additionally, we have agreements with Cheniere Marketing for which the related revenues are recorded as LNG revenues—affiliate.  See Note 13—Related Party Transactions for additional information regarding these agreements. Revenues from the sale of LNG are recognized at a point in time when the LNG is delivered to the customer based on the delivery terms described above, which is the point legal title, physical possession and the risks and rewards of ownership transfer to the customer.  Each individual molecule of LNG is viewed as a separate performance obligation.  We allocate the contract price (including both fixed and variable fees) in each LNG sales arrangement based on the stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation as of at the time the contract was negotiated.  We have concluded that the variable fees meet the exception for allocating variable consideration to specific parts of the contract.  As such, the variable consideration for these contracts is allocated to each distinct molecule of LNG and recognized when that distinct molecule of LNG is delivered to the customer.  Because of the use of the exception, variable consideration related to the sale of LNG is also not included in the transaction price. When we sell LNG on a DAT basis, we rely on our agreement with our marketing affiliate for all fulfillment costs.  We expense fulfillment costs as incurred unless otherwise dictated by GAAP. Fees received pursuant to SPAs are recognized as LNG revenues only after substantial completion of the respective Train.  Prior to substantial completion, sales generated during the commissioning phase are offset against the cost of construction for the respective Train, as the production and removal of LNG from storage is necessary to test the facility and bring the asset to the condition necessary for its intended use. Sales of natural gas where, in the delivery of the natural gas to the end customer, we have concluded that we acted as a principal are presented within revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, and where we have concluded that we acted as an agent are netted within cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

[728]: Table element - Text before table: As of December 31, 2023, the available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position include primarily fixed-rate debt securities of varying maturities, which are sensitive to changes in the yield curve and other market conditions. Approximately 99 percent of the fixed-rate debt securities in a loss position are investment-grade debt securities. As of December 31, 2023, we do not intend to sell, and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell, the securities in a loss position before the market values recover or the underlying cash flows have been received, and there is no indication of a material default on interest or principal payments for our debt securities.

[603]: Table element - Text before table: Foreign Currency Translation Operations in our subsidiaries outside the United States (U.S.) are recorded in the functional currency of each subsidiary which is determined by a review of the environment where each subsidiary primarily generates and expends cash. The results of operations for our subsidiaries outside the U.S. are translated from functional currencies into U.S. dollars using the weighted-average currency rate for the period. Assets and liabilities are translated using the period end exchange rates. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from translating the net assets of these subsidiaries are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). Advertising Expenses Costs associated with advertising are expensed as incurred and are included in marketing, selling, and administrative expenses. Advertising expenses, comprised primarily of online marketing and television advertising, totaled $ 1.12 billion, $ 966.8 million, and $ 1.24 billion in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, which was less than 5 percent of revenue each year. Other Significant Accounting Policies Our other significant accounting policies are described in the remaining appropriate notes to the consolidated financial statements. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to conform with the current presentation. Development milestone payments related to externally developed IPR&D projects, acquired directly in a transaction other than a business combination, were previously included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows and are now included in purchases of IPR&D in cash flows from investing activities. The reclassification resulted in an increase to net cash provided by operating activities and net cash used in investing activities of $ 501.3 million and $ 105.2 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Implementation of New Financial Accounting Standards Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures , establishes incremental disaggregation of income tax disclosures pertaining to the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and requires prospective application with the option to apply it retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We intend to adopt this standard in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2025. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this standard on our disclosures. ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, requires disclosures about significant segment expenses and additional interim disclosure requirements. This standard also requires a single reportable segment to provide all disclosures required by ASC 280. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted, and the amendments should be applied retrospectively for all prior periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. We intend to adopt this standard in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this standard on our disclosures.

Outside the U.S. the lower realized prices in 2023 were primarily driven by a new supply arrangement associated with the sale of the rights for the olanzapine portfolio and lower realized prices from Trulicity, Verzenio, and Humalog.

[911]: Table element - Text before table: Adjusted Gross Margin
We define adjusted gross margin as revenues less cost of sales, exclusive of operating expenses and depreciation and amortization. We disclose adjusted gross margin in addition to gross margin as defined by GAAP because it is the primary performance measure used by our management to evaluate consolidated operations. We believe adjusted gross margin is an important measure because, in general, our business is to gather, process, transport, or market natural gas, NGLs, condensate, and crude oil for a fee or to purchase and resell natural gas, NGLs, condensate, and crude oil for a margin. Operating expense is a separate measure used by our management to evaluate the operating performance of field operations. Direct labor and supervision, property insurance, property taxes, repair and maintenance, utilities, and contract services comprise the most significant portion of our operating expenses. We exclude all operating expenses and depreciation and amortization from adjusted gross margin because these expenses are largely independent of the volumes we transport or process and fluctuate depending on the activities performed during a specific period. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to adjusted gross margin is gross margin. Adjusted gross margin should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, gross margin as determined in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted gross margin has important limitations because it excludes all operating expenses and depreciation and amortization that affect gross margin. Our adjusted gross margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other entities may not calculate these amounts in the same manner.

Impairments . For the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized an impairment expense of $20.7 million due to changes in our outlook for future cash flows and the anticipated use of certain ORV crude assets in our Louisiana segment. We determined that the carrying amounts of these assets exceeded their fair value, based on market inputs and certain assumptions.
(Gain) Loss on Disposition of Assets . For the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized a gain on disposition of assets of $0.3 million, which was primarily due to the divestitures of our ORV assets in our Louisiana segment. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 3” for additional information.

[358]: Consolidated Revenue [/358]
[360]: The decrease in total revenue for 2023, as compared to 2022, was driven, in part, by the business exits discussed in Executive Overview , which resulted in a decrease in revenue of approximately $52 million for 2023, as well as the continuing secular decline in order volume for checks, business forms and some Promotional Solutions business accessories. These decreases in revenue were partially offset by price increases in response to the inflationary environment, primarily in our Promotional Solutions and Checks segments, as well as growth from new business and favorable volumes for data-driven marketing and merchant services. [/360]
[361]: We do not manage our business based on product versus service revenue. Instead, we analyze our revenue based on the product and service offerings shown under the caption ""Note 17: Business Segment Information"" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Part II, Item 8 of this report.

[426]: Payments [/426]
[427]: Results for our Payments segment were as follows: [/427]
[429]: The increase in total revenue for 2023, as compared to 2022, was due to an increase in merchant services revenue of 4.8%, driven by strong merchant fees and volume. Treasury management revenue was flat year-over-year as price increases in response to the inflationary environment were offset by the impact of non-recurring revenue in the prior year and continued demand softness for lockbox services. For 2024, we expect mid-single digit percentage revenue growth for this segment. [/429]
[362]: Table element - Text before table: The decrease in total revenue for 2023, as compared to 2022, was driven, in part, by the business exits discussed in Executive Overview , which resulted in a decrease in revenue of approximately $52 million for 2023, as well as the continuing secular decline in order volume for checks, business forms and some Promotional Solutions business accessories. These decreases in revenue were partially offset by price increases in response to the inflationary environment, primarily in our Promotional Solutions and Checks segments, as well as growth from new business and favorable volumes for data-driven marketing and merchant services.
We do not manage our business based on product versus service revenue. Instead, we analyze our revenue based on the product and service offerings shown under the caption ""Note 17: Business Segment Information"" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Part II, Item 8 of this report.

                    The question is: What are the revenues for the 12 month period ending december 2023?  possible values: any number (positive or negative, including decimals)
 We also want to retrieve some meta information. In the following we will present the meta item ID and then the additional question to be answered, format: (META_ID): QUESTION.
(currency): What is the currency  possible values (select one from json array): ['USD', 'EUR', 'Other']
(unit): What is the unit?  possible values (select one from json array): ['none', 'thousands', 'millions', 'billions'] 

                    
                     


                    Your answer should be formatted as a JSON object. Under the key 'answers' can be one or more JSON object(s), with key value pairs for the main question and the meta items. For the main question use the key 'main_question', for the meta items use their ID as key. Under the key 'sources', you should also provide the numbers of the text fragments you used to answer the question. For example your answer could look like this: {""answers"": [{""main_question"": ""123"", ""currency"": ""USD"", ""unit"": ""none""}], ""sources"": [241, 423]}

[956]: Table element - Text before table: Product revenues, net, for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased to $305.2 million as compared to $245.4 million in 2022 as a result of the growth in sales of ARIKAYCE in the US, Japan and Europe and the rest of the world. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we reached an agreement with the French authorities on the final reimbursement price related to the ATU program in France and we are required to refund the difference. This final pricing resulted in a change in estimate that reduced revenue by approximately $7.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, of which $5.8 million related to periods prior to 2022.

[1261]: Table element - Text before table: In accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, the Company recognizes revenue when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for the goods or services provided. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (1) identify the contracts with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation. At contract inception, the Company assesses the goods or services promised within each contract to determine which are performance obligations and to assess whether each promised good or service is distinct. The Company then recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when or as the performance obligation is satisfied. For all contracts that fall into the scope of ASC 606, the Company has identified one performance obligation: the sale of ARIKAYCE to its customers. The Company has not incurred or capitalized any incremental costs associated with obtaining contracts with customers.
Product revenues, net consist of net sales of ARIKAYCE. The Company's customers in the US include specialty pharmacies and specialty distributors. In December 2020, the Company began recognizing product revenue from commercial sales of ARIKAYCE in Europe. In July 2021, the Company began recognizing product revenue from commercial sales of ARIKAYCE in Japan. Globally, product revenues are recognized once the Company performs and satisfies all five steps of the revenue recognition criteria mentioned above.

[1390]: Table element - Text before table: Law Changes
On August 16, 2022, the IRA was enacted into law containing corporate income tax provisions such as the corporate alternative minimum tax and an excise tax on the repurchase of corporate stock. These provisions are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s income taxes in the near term.
The financial statement recognition of the benefit for a tax position is dependent upon the benefit being more likely than not to be sustainable upon audit by the applicable taxing authority. If this threshold is met, the tax benefit is then measured and recognized at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If such unrecognized tax benefits were realized and not subject to valuation allowances, the Company would recognize a tax benefit of $ 14.8 million.

[1503]: Table element - Text before table: On October 9, 2023, the SED submitted for adoption by the CPUC a draft resolution approving an Administrative Consent Order and Agreement between the SED and the Utility (the “Dixie ACO”).  The Dixie ACO would resolve the SED’s investigation into the 2021 Dixie fire.  The Dixie ACO provides that the Utility would (i) pay $ 2.5 million to California’s General Fund; (ii) pay $ 2.5 million to tribes impacted by the 2021 Dixie fire; (iii) and undertake an initiative to transition to electronic records for specified patrols and inspections of distribution facilities, at an approximate cost of $ 40 million over five years , and the Utility may not seek recovery of such costs.  The SED agreed to refrain from instituting any further enforcement proceedings against the Utility related to the 2021 Dixie fire.  The Dixie ACO states that it does not constitute an admission or evidence of any wrongdoing, fault, omission, negligence, imprudence, or liability on the part of the Utility.  The Dixie ACO also states that the parties to it intend that it shall not affect whether the Utility may obtain recovery of costs and expenses incurred in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire, including for amounts drawn from the Wildfire Fund or otherwise sought through a cost recovery application to the CPUC.  On February 2, 2024, the CPUC issued a final decision approving the Dixie ACO.  In connection with the Dixie ACO, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded a liability of $ 5 million reflected in Other current liabilities on the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2023.  For the recordkeeping initiative costs for which the Utility will not seek recovery, the Utility expects to record disallowances as such costs are incurred. As of February 14, 2024, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are aware of approximately 161 complaints on behalf of at least 8,387 individual plaintiffs and a separate putative class complaint related to the 2021 Dixie fire and expect that they may receive further complaints.  The plaintiffs seek damages that include wrongful death, property damage, economic loss, medical monitoring, punitive damages, exemplary damages, attorneys’ fees and other damages.  On September 20, 2023, the court vacated the November 8, 2023 trial date and scheduled a new trial date for April 2, 2024.  On June 30, 2023, Cal Fire also filed a complaint largely repeating the allegations of the earlier Cal Fire Investigation Report and seeking damages for fire suppression and investigation costs. On January 17, 2023, PG&E Corporation and the Utility reached an agreement with certain public entities to settle their claims for $ 24 million. On March 2, 2023, PG&E Corporation and the Utility entered into an agreement with the insurance subrogation plaintiffs in the 2021 Dixie fire litigation to resolve their claims arising from the 2021 Dixie fire. Based on the current state of the law concerning inverse condemnation in California and the facts and circumstances available to PG&E Corporation and the Utility as of the date of this filing, including Cal Fire’s determination of the cause and the information gathered as part of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s investigation, PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe it is probable that they will incur a loss in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded a liability in the aggregate amount of $ 1.175 billion as of December 31, 2022 (before available recoveries).  Based on the facts and circumstances available to PG&E Corporation and the Utility as of the date of this filing, including their experience to date in settling the claims of individual plaintiffs, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded an additional charge in the third quarter of 2023 for probable losses in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire of $ 425 million for an aggregate liability of $ 1.6 billion (before available insurance) as of December 31, 2023. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s accrued estimated losses of $ 1.6 billion do not include, among other things: (i) any amounts for potential penalties or fines that may be imposed by courts or other governmental entities on PG&E Corporation or the Utility, (ii) any punitive damages, (iii) any amounts in respect of compensation claims by federal or state agencies including for state or federal fire suppression costs and damages related to federal land, (iv) medical monitoring costs, or (v) any other amounts that are not reasonably estimable. As noted above, the aggregate estimated liability for claims in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire does not include potential claims for fire suppression costs from federal, state, county, or local agencies or damage to land and vegetation in national parks or national forests.  As to these damages, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have not concluded that a loss is probable.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to reasonably estimate the range of possible losses for any such claims due to, among other factors, incomplete information as to facts pertinent to potential claims and defenses, as well as facts that would bear on the amount, type, and valuation of vegetation loss, potential reforestation, habitat loss, and other resources damaged or destroyed by the 2021 Dixie fire.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe, however, that such losses could be significant with respect to fire suppression costs due to the size and duration of the 2021 Dixie fire and corresponding magnitude of fire suppression resources dedicated to fighting the 2021 Dixie fire and with respect to claims for damage to land and vegetation in national parks or national forests due to the very large number of acres of national parks and national forests that were affected by the 2021 Dixie fire.  According to the Cal Fire Investigation Report, over $ 650 million of costs had been incurred in suppressing the 2021 Dixie fire.  The Utility estimates that the fire burned approximately 70,000 acres of national parks and approximately 685,000 acres of national forests.

[1496]: Table element - Text before table: 2020 Zogg Fire According to Cal Fire, on September 27, 2020, at approximately 4:03 p.m. Pacific Time, a wildfire began in the area of Zogg Mine Road and Jenny Bird Lane, north of Igo in Shasta County, California (the “2020 Zogg fire”), located in the service area of the Utility.  According to a Cal Fire incident update dated October 16, 2020, 3:08 p.m. Pacific Time, the 2020 Zogg fire consumed 56,338 acres and resulted in four fatalities, one injury, 204 structures destroyed, and 27 structures damaged. On March 22, 2021, Cal Fire issued a press release with its determination that the 2020 Zogg fire was caused by a pine tree contacting electrical facilities owned and operated by the Utility located north of the community of Igo. As of February 14, 2024, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have settled or reached settlements in principle with substantially all individual plaintiffs. On September 26, 2022, the Utility entered into a tolling agreement with Cal OES, which remains in effect. Based on the current state of the law concerning inverse condemnation in California and the facts and circumstances available to PG&E Corporation and the Utility as of the date of this filing, including Cal Fire’s determination of the cause and the information gathered as part of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s investigation, PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe it is probable that they will incur a loss in connection with the 2020 Zogg fire.  Based on the facts and circumstances available to PG&E Corporation and the Utility as of the date of this report, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded a liability in the aggregate amount of $ 400 million as of December 31, 2022 (before available insurance).  The aggregate liability remained unchanged as of December 31, 2023. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s accrued estimated losses represent the best estimate of the liability and does not include any claims related to the Cal OES complaint or any punitive damages.

As noted above, the aggregate estimated liability for claims in connection with the 2022 Mosquito fire does not include potential claims for fire suppression costs from federal, state, county, or local agencies or damage to land and vegetation in national parks or national forests.  As to these damages, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have not concluded that a loss is probable.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to reasonably estimate the range of possible losses for any such claims due to, among other factors, incomplete information as to facts pertinent to potential claims and defenses, as well as facts that would bear on the amount, type, and valuation of vegetation loss, potential reforestation, habitat loss, and other resources damaged or destroyed by the 2022 Mosquito fire.

[615]: Table element - Text before table: We are subject to federal, state and foreign income taxes for jurisdictions in which we operate, and we use estimates in determining our income tax provision and deferred tax assets. Earnings from our non-U.S. activities are subject to income taxes in the local countries at rates which are generally similar to the U.S. statutory tax rate. We regularly assess the realizability of our net deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2023, valuation allowances remain in certain jurisdictions where we believe it is necessary to see further positive evidence, such as sustained achievement of sufficient profits to meet a more likely than not stance that the valuation allowance should be reversed. If additional positive evidence becomes available in the foreseeable future, we may release all or a portion of the valuation allowance. The exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release is subject to change based on the level of profitability achieved in future periods. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and a corresponding decrease to income tax expense in the period the release is recorded.

Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses as a percentage of net revenues in the year ended December 31, 2023 increased to 43.1%, as compared to 41.8% in the year ended December 31, 2022, due primarily to higher amortization of acquired intangibles from the acquisitions of Frontline and Syntellis and restructuring-related expenses incurred primarily in connection with the integration of the Syntellis acquisition. The resulting operating margin was 25.8% in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 27.1% in the year ended December 31, 2022. [/337]

Indicor – On November 22, 2022, Roper completed the divestiture of a majority 51 % stake in Indicor to CD&R for approximately $ 2,604 in cash. The consideration was comprised of a cash distribution of approximately $ 1,775 funded by third-party indebtedness incurred by Indicor and approximately $ 829 related to the majority 51 % equity stake. The Company retained an initial 49 % minority equity interest. The sale resulted in a pretax gain of $ 2,046.0 , which included $ 142.6 of foreign currency translation losses and $ 535.0 associated with the initial remaining 49 % interest in Indicor (described further in Note 10). The Company recognized income tax expense of $ 407.2 associated with the gain.

Revenue Recognition – The reported results reflect the application of ASC 606 guidance. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for these products and/or services. To achieve this principle, the Company applies the following five steps: • identify the contract with the customer; • identify the performance obligations in the contract; • determine the transaction price; • allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and • recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation.
Disaggregated Revenue – We disaggregate our revenues by reportable segment into four categories: (i) recurring revenue comprised of Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”), annual term licenses, and software maintenance; (ii) reoccurring revenue comprised of transactional and volume-based fees related to software licenses; (iii) non-recurring revenue comprised of multi-year term and perpetual software licenses, professional services associated with software products and hardware sold with our software licenses; and (iv) product revenue.

The growth of 14.7% in organic revenues was broad-based across the segment led by our water meter technology business and medical products businesses. Gross margin increased to 57.1% in the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 56.9% in the year ended December 31, 2022, due primarily to operating leverage on higher organic revenues, partially offset by revenue mix. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues remained relatively consistent at 23.7% in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 23.8% in the year ended December 31, 2022. The resulting operating margin was 33.4% in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 33.2% in the year ended December 31, 2022.

We manage each of our brands’ United States and Canada operations as an operating and reportable segment and our international operations as an operating and reportable segment. As part of this reevaluation, we moved the international components of our previous operating segments to the new International segment with no changes to the composition of any reporting units.

Amortization expense on intangible assets totaled $ 37 million for 2023, $ 39 million for 2022, and $ 41 million for 2021. The change in the franchise agreements, brands and goodwill balances during 2023 was primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation.

Contract Liabilities
Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue resulting from initial and renewal franchise fees paid by franchisees, as well as upfront fees paid by master franchisees, which are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the underlying agreement. We may recognize unamortized franchise fees and upfront fees when a contract with a franchisee or master franchisee is modified and is accounted for as a termination of the existing contract. We classify these contract liabilities as Other liabilities, net in our consolidated balance sheets.

However, this is a percentage change and not the actual revenue value. The actual revenue value for the 12 month period ending December 2023 is not provided in the text fragments.

The currency for the revenues is not explicitly mentioned in the text fragments, so it is not possible to provide a value for the (currency) meta item.

The unit for the revenues is not explicitly mentioned in the text fragments, so it is not possible to provide a value for the (unit) meta item.

Regarding the meta information:

(currency): The currency is not explicitly stated in the provided data. However, it can be inferred that the currency used is USD, as the financial figures are presented in US dollars.

(unit): The unit for the financial figures is not explicitly stated in the provided data. However, it can be inferred that the unit is 'millions', as the financial figures are presented in thousands and millions.

                    Your answer should be formatted as a JSON object. Under the key 'answers' can be one or more JSON object(s), with key value pairs for the main question and the meta items. For the main question use the key 'main_question', for the meta items use their ID as key. Under the key 'sources', you should also provide the numbers of the text fragments you used to answer the question.

[613]: The
          following table summarizes the divestiture & other related costs for the year ended December 31, 2021: [/613]
[616]: The Company recorded non-cash impairment charges in Selling and Administrative Expenses, primarily related to property, plant, and equipment and allocated goodwill, during the year ended December 31, 2021, when the estimated fair value less costs to sell the product line was lower than its carrying value. The estimated fair values for
      the inks and fragrances (excluding its essential oils product line) product lines were determined based on indicative bids, which are classified as Level 3 inputs in the fair value measurement hierarchy. The Company recorded non-cash charges in Cost of Products Sold during the year ended December 31, 2021, to reduce the carrying value of certain inventories, when they were determined to be excess. The
      Company recorded a non-cash loss during the year ended December 31, 2021, related to the reclassification of foreign currency translation and related items from Accumulated





















        Other Comprehensive Loss to Selling and Administrative Expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. [/616]
[301]: Table element - Text before table: Within the following tables, the Company reports certain non-GAAP financial measures, including: (1) adjusted operating income, adjusted net earnings, and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which exclude the divestiture
        & other related income and restructuring and other costs, including the portfolio optimization plan costs and (2) percentage changes in revenue, operating income, and diluted earnings per share on an adjusted local currency basis, which
        eliminate the effects that result from translating its international operations into U.S. dollars, the divestiture & other related income, and restructuring and other costs, including the portfolio optimization plan costs.
The Company has included each of these non-GAAP measures in order to provide additional information regarding our underlying operating results and comparable year-over-year performance. Such information is supplemental to
        information presented in accordance with GAAP and is not intended to represent a presentation in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation. Rather, they should be considered together with GAAP measures and
        the rest of the information included in this report. Management internally reviews each of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate performance on a comparative period-to-period basis and to gain additional insight into underlying operating and
        performance trends, and the Company believes the information can be beneficial to investors for the same purposes. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

The relevant information was found in the consolidated statements of operations table in fragment [813], which shows total operating revenues of $2,373,886,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The currency is USD based on the table being in thousands of dollars, and the unit is thousands.","{""answers"": [{""main_question"": 2363889, ""currency"": ""USD"", ""unit"": ""thousands""}], ""sources"": [813]}","Based on the provided text fragments, the revenues for the 12 month period ending December 2023 can be found in text fragment [813]. In this fragment, the ""Total operating revenues and other income"" for the year 2023 is given as $2,373,886 (in thousands). Therefore, the revenues for the 12 month period ending December 2023 are $2,373,886.

The currency for this value is USD, as indicated in text fragment [656], which states ""Net derivative (gain) loss is a result of changes in fair values associated with fluctuations in the forward price curves for the commodities underlying our outstanding derivative contracts and the monthly cash settlements of our derivative positions during the period. We expect increases in benchmark commodity prices to result in net derivative losses, and decreases in benchmark commodity prices to result in net derivative gains, as measured against our derivative contract prices. Please refer to Note 7 – Derivative Financial Instruments in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional discussion."" The use of the term ""benchmark commodity prices"" and ""derivative contract prices"" suggests that the currency is USD.

The unit for this value is thousands, as indicated by the ""(in thousands)"" notation in text fragment [813].

Therefore, the answer is:

This could be interpreted as the total revenue for the year.

[778]: Table element - Text before table: Adjusted EBITDAX represents net income (loss) before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depletion, depreciation, amortization and asset retirement obligation liability accretion expense, exploration expense, property abandonment and impairment expense, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, derivative gains and losses net of settlements, gains and losses on divestitures, gains and losses on extinguishment of debt, and certain other items.  Adjusted EBITDAX excludes certain items that we believe affect the comparability of operating results and can exclude items that are generally non-recurring in nature or whose timing and/or amount cannot be reasonably estimated.  Adjusted EBITDAX is a non-GAAP measure that we believe provides useful additional information to investors and analysts, as a performance measure, for analysis of our ability to internally generate funds for exploration, development, acquisitions, and to service debt.  We are also subject to financial covenants under our Credit Agreement as further described in Note 5 – Long-Term Debt in Part II, Item 8 of this report.  In addition, adjusted EBITDAX is widely used by professional research analysts and others in the valuation, comparison, and investment recommendations of companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry, and many investors use the published research of industry research analysts in making investment decisions.  Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, net cash provided by operating activities, or other profitability or liquidity measures prepared under GAAP.  Because adjusted EBITDAX excludes some, but not all items that affect net income (loss) and may vary among companies, the adjusted EBITDAX amounts presented may not be comparable to similar metrics of other companies.  Our revolving credit facility provides a material source of liquidity for us.  Under the terms of our Credit Agreement, if we failed to comply with the covenants that establish a maximum permitted ratio of total funded debt, as defined in the Credit Agreement, to adjusted EBITDAX, we would be in default, an event that would prevent us from borrowing under our revolving credit facility and would therefore materially limit a significant source of our liquidity.  In addition, if we are in default under our revolving credit facility and are unable to obtain a waiver of that default from our lenders, lenders under that facility and under the indentures governing each series of our outstanding Senior Notes, as defined in Note 5 – Long-Term Debt in Part II, Item 8 of this report, would be entitled to exercise all of their remedies for default.

[635]: Table element - Text before table: Average net daily equivalent production volumes for the year ended December 31, 2022, increased three percent compared with 2021, comprised of a 37 percent increase from our South Texas assets, partially offset by a 14 percent decrease from our Midland Basin assets.  As a result of increases in benchmark commodity prices, realized prices for oil, gas, and NGLs increased 40 percent, 29 percent, and six percent, respectively, resulting in a 29 percent increase in oil, gas, and NGL production revenue.  Oil, gas, and NGL production expense for the year ended December 31, 2022, increased 23 percent, compared with 2021, primarily as a result of increased production taxes and LOE.

Revenue increased by $163.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to an increased number of solar energy systems in service. The weighted average number of systems (excluding systems with loan agreements, service-only agreements and cash sales) increased from approximately 128,300 for the year ended December 31, 2022 to approximately 168,500 for the year ended December 31, 2023. Excluding SREC revenue, revenue under our loan agreements, inventory sales revenue, cash sales revenue, direct sales revenue and service revenue, on a weighted average number of systems basis, revenue remained relatively flat at $1,632 per system for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $1,643 per system for the same period in 2023 (1% increase). Inventory sales revenue decreased by $10.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 due to our dealers having sufficient inventory on hand from prior purchases. Service revenue increased by $12.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to an increase in repair service revenue. Direct sales revenue increased by $52.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 due to an increased focus on direct sales of additional services to existing customers. On a weighted average number of systems basis, revenues under our loan agreements (excluding accessory loans, which do not generate revenue) increased from $345 per system for the year ended December 31, 2022 to $405 per system for the same period in 2023 (17% increase) primarily due to an increase in the fees charged for operations and maintenance services.

                    The question is: What are the revenues for the 12 month period ending december 2023?  possible values: any number (positive or negative, including decimals)
 We also want to retrieve some meta information. In the following we will present the meta item ID and then the additional question to be answered, format: (META_ID): QUESTION.
(currency): What is the currency  possible values (select one from json array): ['USD', 'EUR', 'Other']
(unit): What is the unit?  possible values (select one from json array): ['none', 'thousands', 'millions', 'billions'] 

                    
                     


                    Your answer should be formatted as a JSON object. Under the key 'answers' can be one or more JSON object(s), with key value pairs for the main question and the meta items. For the main question use the key 'main_question', for the meta items use their ID as key. Under the key 'sources', you should also provide the numbers of the text fragments you used to answer the question.

Note 5. Revenue Recognition and Contract Balances
The Company disaggregates its revenue from contracts with customers by customer type and geographic region for each of our segments, as the Company believes it best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of its revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.  With the exception of the Engineered Systems segment, net sales in each of our segments is primarily derived from fixed-price contracts.  Net sales in the Engineered Systems segment are typically between 45 % and 55 % fixed-price contracts in a given reporting period, with the balance of net sales related to cost-reimbursable type contracts.  For 2023, 2022 and 2021, approximately 49 %, 49 %, and 47 % of net sales in the Engineered Systems segment was derived from fixed-price contracts.; table: (row 0)

Explanation:

The revenues for the 12 month period ending December 2023 are $3,471,417 (in thousands), as shown in the ""Total revenues"" row for the year 2023 in the table provided in fragment [1079]. The currency used is USD, and the unit is thousands.","You are supposed to answer a question based on text fragments that are provided. The fragments start with a number in square brackets and then the actual text. The end of the fragment is shown by the same number in square brackets, only that the number is preceded by a slash. E.g. [22] Some Text [/22]. The lower the number of the fragment, the earlier the fragment appeared in the document (reading from left to right, top to bottom).  


                    The question is: What are the revenues for the 12 month period ending december 2023?  possible values: any number (positive or negative, including decimals)
 We also want to retrieve some meta information. In the following we will present the meta item ID and then the additional question to be answered, format: (META_ID): QUESTION.
(currency): What is the currency  possible values (select one from json array): ['USD', 'EUR', 'Other']
(unit): What is the unit?  possible values (select one from json array): ['none', 'thousands', 'millions', 'billions'] 

                    
                     


                    Your answer should be formatted as a JSON object. Under the key 'answers' can be one or more JSON object(s), with key value pairs for the main question and the meta items. For the main question use the key 'main_question', for the meta items use their ID as key. Under the key 'sources', you should also provide the numbers of the text fragments you used to answer the question. For example your answer could look like this: {""answers"": [{""main_question"": ""123"", ""currency"": ""USD"", ""unit"": ""none""}], ""sources"": [241, 423]}

[1276]: Use of Estimates The Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements requires it to make estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The most significant estimates in the Company’s consolidated financial statements relate to its stock appreciation milestone obligations, contracts containing leases, and accrued expenses. Although these estimates are based on the Company’s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately materially differ from these estimates and assumptions.

[133]: Table element - Text before table: Anchor space over 10,000 square feet is not physically connected to the mall, does not share the same common area amenities and does not benefit from the foot traffic in the mall.  As a result, space greater than 10,000 square feet has a unique rent structure that is inconsistent with mall space under 10,000 square feet.
Cost of Occupancy:
A major factor contributing to tenant profitability is cost of occupancy, which consists of tenant occupancy costs charged by the Company. Tenant occupancy costs include tenant expenses such as minimum rents, percentage rents and recoverable expenditures, which consist primarily of property operating expenses and real estate taxes. These costs are then compared to tenant sales to present tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of tenant sales. A low cost of occupancy percentage shows more potential capacity for the Company to increase rents at the time of lease renewal than a high cost of occupancy percentage. The following table summarizes occupancy costs for Mall Store and Freestanding Store tenants in the Centers as a percentage of total Mall Store sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022:; table: (row 0)

(unit): What is the unit?  possible values (select one from json array): ['none', 'thousands', 'millions', 'billions'] 

                    
                     


                    Your answer should be formatted as a JSON object. Under the key 'answers' can be one or more JSON object(s), with key value pairs for the main question and the meta items. For the main question use the key 'main_question', for the meta items use their ID as key. Under the key 'sources', you should also provide the numbers of the text fragments you used to answer the question.

[826]: Table element - Text before table: Below is a reconciliation of Credit Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the closest GAAP financial measure. Our Credit Agreement defines Adjusted EBITDA (which we call “Credit Adjusted EBITDA”) as net income before (i) interest expense, (ii) interest income, (iii) provision for income taxes, (iv) depreciation and amortization expense, (v) impairment of intangible assets, (vi) stock-based compensation, (vii) contingent consideration, (viii) acquisition and related expenses, and (ix) certain other items. We calculate Credit Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Credit Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenues.
Credit Adjusted EBITDA and Credit Adjusted EBITDA Margin as calculated herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies within the industry and are not determined in accordance with GAAP.

Segment assets are not reviewed by the Company’s chief operating decision maker function and therefore are not disclosed below.
Segment operating income consists of revenue generated by a segment, less the direct costs of service revenues and general and administrative expenses that are incurred directly by the segment. Unallocated general and administrative costs are those costs for functions performed in a centralized manner and therefore not attributable to a particular segment.

Goodwill and certain state licenses are not amortized pursuant to ASC Topic 350. We test intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis, as of October 1, or whenever potential impairment triggers occur, such as a significant change in business climate or regulatory changes that would indicate that an impairment may have occurred. The Company estimates the fair value of the reporting unit using both a discounted cash flow model as well as a market multiple model. The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate based on the Company’s estimate of a market participant’s weighted-average cost of capital. These models are both based on the Company’s best estimate of future revenues and operating costs and are reconciled to the Company’s consolidated market capitalization, with consideration of the amount a potential acquirer would be required to pay, in the form of a control premium. The determination of fair value in the Company’s goodwill impairment analysis is based on an estimate of fair value for each reporting unit utilizing known and estimated inputs at the evaluation date. Some of those inputs include, but are not limited to, the most recent price of the Company’s common stock and fair value of long term debt, estimates of future revenue and expense growth, estimated market multiples, expected capital expenditures, income tax rates and cost of invested c apital. Significant assumptions used in the analysis included a 10.0 % discount rate and long-term revenue growth rates that ranged from 3.5 % to 5.8 %. The Company did no t record any impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 or 2021.

Additionally, in the event of any contemplated asset sale or series of asset sales yielding net proceeds in excess of $ 2,500 , except those excluded per the Oxford Loan Agreement, we are required to prepay the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the Term Loans in an amount equal to the entire amount of the asset sale net proceeds, plus any accrued and unpaid interest.
The Oxford Loan Agreement includes financial covenants that require the Borrower Parties to (i) maintain minimum liquidity, as defined in the Loan Agreement, of $ 23.0 million and (ii) satisfy a maximum permitted ratio of debt to trailing twelve-month revenue, as set forth in the Loan Agreement. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the Oxford financial covenants.

[980]: Table element - Text before table: Revenues. Earned premium revenues were $1,800.9 million and $1,431.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, an increase of $369.4 million or 25.8%. The increase was driven by a combination of growth in our Health Plan membership and higher revenue per member per month in 2023 as compared to 2022. Health plan membership increased 21.2% between December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The increase in revenue per member per month is primarily attributable to an increase in the CMS benchmark rates. Additionally, ACO REACH revenue, also included in earned premiums, increased $73.0 million, or 143.3% for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. Other revenues increased $20.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of 770%. The increase is mainly attributable to an increase in the interest rate of our interest earning cash balances.

}","You are supposed to answer a question based on text fragments that are provided. The fragments start with a number in square brackets and then the actual text. The end of the fragment is shown by the same number in square brackets, only that the number is preceded by a slash. E.g. [22] Some Text [/22]. The lower the number of the fragment, the earlier the fragment appeared in the document (reading from left to right, top to bottom).  


                    The question is: What are the revenues for the 12 month period ending december 2023?  possible values: any number (positive or negative, including decimals)
 We also want to retrieve some meta information. In the following we will present the meta item ID and then the additional question to be answered, format: (META_ID): QUESTION.
(currency): What is the currency  possible values (select one from json array): ['USD', 'EUR', 'Other']
(unit): What is the unit?  possible values (select one from json array): ['none', 'thousands', 'millions', 'billions'] 

                    
                     


                    Your answer should be formatted as a JSON object. Under the key 'answers' can be one or more JSON object(s), with key value pairs for the main question and the meta items. For the main question use the key 'main_question', for the meta items use their ID as key. Under the key 'sources', you should also provide the numbers of the text fragments you used to answer the question. For example your answer could look like this: {""answers"": [{""main_question"": ""123"", ""currency"": ""USD"", ""unit"": ""none""}], ""sources"": [241, 423]}

Realized gains or losses on investments for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were no t material. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022,  it was determined that no credit losses exist, because the change in market value of those securities resulted from fluctuations in market interest rates since the time of purchase, rather than a deterioration of the credit worthiness of the issuers. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, all securities have a maturity of 18 months or less and all securities with gross unrealized losses have been in a continuous loss position for less than one year. The Company generally holds its marketable securities until maturity and does not intend to sell, and is not required to sell, the investments that are in an unrealized loss position before the recovery of their amortized cost basis.

We generally recognize estimated contract revenue and resulting income over time based on the measurement of the extent of progress toward completion using total costs incurred as a percentage of the total estimated project costs for individual performance obligations. We review contract price and cost estimates periodically as the work progresses and reflect adjustments proportionate to the percentage-of-completion in income in the period when those estimates are revised. If a current estimate of total contract costs indicates a loss on a contract, the projected loss is recognized in full when determined. It is possible that current estimates could materially change for various reasons, including, but not limited to, fluctuations in forecasted labor productivity or raw material prices. We routinely review estimates related to our contracts, and revisions to profitability are reflected in the quarterly and annual earnings we report. The aggregate impact of changes in estimates increased our revenue and operating income as follows:; table: (row 0)

[734]: Table element - Text before table: Performance Obligations
As we progress on our contracts and the underlying performance obligations for which we recognize revenue over time, we refine our estimates of variable consideration and total estimated costs at completion, which impact the overall profitability on our contracts and performance obligations. Changes in these estimates result in the recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments that impact our revenues and/or costs of contracts.

[/465]
[466]: Consolidated Results of Operations [/466]
[467]: Year Ended December 31, 2023 vs. 2022 [/467]
[468]: Consolidated revenues increased 11.8%, or $263.5 million, to $2,496.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $2,232.8 million in 2022, due to increases in revenues in our Government Operations and Commercial Operations segments of $222.9 million and $39.0 million, respectively. [/468]
[469]: Consolidated operating income increased $34.5 million to $383.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $348.6 million in 2022. Operating income in our Government Operations and Commercial Operations segments increased $38.2 million and $10.1 million, respectively. These increases were partially offset by higher Unallocated Corporate expenses of $13.8 million. [/469]
[937]: Table element - Text before table: NOTE 15 – SEGMENT REPORTING
As described in Note 1, our operations are assessed based on two reportable segments. The operations of our segments are managed separately, and each segment has unique technology, services and customer classes. We account for intersegment sales at prices that we generally establish by reference to similar transactions with unaffiliated customers. Reportable segments are measured based on operating income exclusive of general corporate expenses and gains (losses) on sales of corporate assets.

The reduction in research and development expenses resulted from evaluation and reallocation of spend away from hardware to offerings that we expect will yield our highest possible returns, as we continue to drive innovation in our technology platform and data insights for customers. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $8.1 million decrease in stock-based compensation, a $5.2 million decrease in salary compensation expense, and a $4.8 million decrease in professional services expense, including consulting services, partially offset by $0.9 million of restructuring charges in accordance with our 2023 Plan.

[620]: Table element - Text before table: Year ended December 31, 2023 compared to year ended December 31, 2022. New pet acquisition expense decreased by $12.1 million, or 14%, to $77.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This decrease was attributable to a decrease in expenses to generate leads and conversion, as we focused on growth in our more efficient channels. New pet acquisition expense as a percentage of revenue was 7% for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 10% in the same period last year, as we were able to stay disciplined with our discretionary pet acquisition spend, while still managing to grow total enrolled subscription pets, excluding those related to managing general agent policies, by 13%.

Technology and development expenses decreased by $3.7 million, or 15%, to $21.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $5.0 million in development expense as several initiatives that were pre-revenue in the prior year were launched and have begun generating revenue. Expenses associated with these initiatives are now recorded within the income statement based on the underlying nature of the expense. This decrease was partially offset by a $1.1 million increase in general compensation and other employee-related expenses and a $0.9 million increase in IT system hosting expenses. Technology and development expenses decreased from 3% to 2% of total revenue year over year

[1135]: Table element - Text before table: In calculating the allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company considered expectations of probable credit losses, including those associated with the COVID-19 pandemic for 2022 and 2021, based on observed trends in cancellations, observed changes in the credit risk of specific customers, the impact of anticipated closures and bankruptcies using forecasted economic indicators in addition to historical experience and loss patterns during periods of macroeconomic uncertainty. The increases in the provision for doubtful accounts and write-offs, net of recoveries in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 as compared to the prior-year periods were a result of the ordinary course of business, reflecting the increase in net revenue as well as higher aggregate customer delinquencies.

The Company did not change the manner in which it recognizes revenue as a result of that assessment.
During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company offered a number of relief incentives to advertising and other revenue customers most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic totaling $ 0.4 million and $ 3.5 million, respectively. These incentives were primarily in the form of waived advertising and subscription fees. The Company accounted for these incentives as price concessions and reduced net revenue recognized in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 accordingly.

Explanation:

The revenues for the 12 month period ending December 2023 can be found in the table provided in fragment [1137]. The total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023, are listed as $1,025,443 (in thousands). Therefore, the revenues in millions of USD are 1,025.443.

The currency used is USD, as indicated by the dollar sign ($) in front of the amounts in the table.

The unit used is millions, as the table states that the dollar amounts are in thousands, and we have converted the given amount to millions.","You are supposed to answer a question based on text fragments that are provided. The fragments start with a number in square brackets and then the actual text. The end of the fragment is shown by the same number in square brackets, only that the number is preceded by a slash. E.g. [22] Some Text [/22]. The lower the number of the fragment, the earlier the fragment appeared in the document (reading from left to right, top to bottom).  


                    The question is: What are the revenues for the 12 month period ending december 2023?  possible values: any number (positive or negative, including decimals)
 We also want to retrieve some meta information. In the following we will present the meta item ID and then the additional question to be answered, format: (META_ID): QUESTION.
(currency): What is the currency  possible values (select one from json array): ['USD', 'EUR', 'Other']
(unit): What is the unit?  possible values (select one from json array): ['none', 'thousands', 'millions', 'billions'] 

                    
                     


                    Your answer should be formatted as a JSON object. Under the key 'answers' can be one or more JSON object(s), with key value pairs for the main question and the meta items. For the main question use the key 'main_question', for the meta items use their ID as key. Under the key 'sources', you should also provide the numbers of the text fragments you used to answer the question. For example your answer could look like this: {""answers"": [{""main_question"": ""123"", ""currency"": ""USD"", ""unit"": ""none""}], ""sources"": [241, 423]}

[1008]: Table element - Text before table: Total proved undeveloped reserves decreased 1 % from 2022 to 2023 with the year-end 2023 balance representing 22 % of total proved reserves. Approximately 59 % of the 177 MMBoe in extensions and discoveries were the result of Devon’s drilling and development activities in the Delaware Basin, followed by the Anadarko Basin ( 14 %), Eagle Ford ( 12 %), Powder River Basin ( 11 %) and Williston Basin ( 4 %). Development in the Delaware Basin accounted for approximately 78 % of the 165 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves being converted to proved developed reserves in 2023. Costs incurred in 2023 to develop and convert Devon’s proved undeveloped reserves were approximately $ 1.5 billion. Proved undeveloped reserves revisions other than price (- 12 MMBoe) were due to changes in previously adopted development plans (- 8 MMBoe) in the Williston Basin (- 5 MMBoe), Delaware Basin (- 2 MMBoe) and Powder River Basin (- 1 MMBoe), combined with modest downward revisions (- 4 MMBoe) caused by continued evaluation of well performance in the Delaware Basin (- 2 MMBoe), Williston Basin (- 1 MMBoe) and Eagle Ford (- 1 MMBoe).

[506]: Table element - Text before table: Table of Contents For the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we generated 92% and 90% of our revenue, respectively, from advertiser customers. We derive revenue primarily from our advertiser customers based on the volume of media transactions, or ads, that our software platform measures (“Media Transactions Measured”). Advertisers utilize the DV Authentic Ad, our definitive metric of digital media quality, to evaluate the existence of fraud, brand safety, viewability and geography for each digital ad. Advertisers pay us a Measured Transaction Fee per thousand impressions based on the volume of Media Transactions Measured on their behalf. The price of most of our solutions is fixed. On platforms that charge based on percent of media spend, our pricing includes caps which effectively mirror our standard fixed fees. We maintain an expansive set of direct integrations across the entire digital advertising ecosystem, including with leading programmatic, CTV, and social platforms, which enable us to deliver our metrics to the platforms where our customers buy ads. Further, our services are not reliant on any single source of impressions and we can service our customers as their digital advertising needs change. In 2023, we estimate that approximately 52% and 48% of Media Transactions Measured within post-campaign measurement were for display and for video ad formats, respectively. In 2022, approximately 55% and 45% of Media Transactions Measured were for display and for video ad formats, respectively. In 2023, approximately 78%, 17% and 5% of Media Transactions Measured were for mobile devices, desktop devices, and emerging digital channels, respectively. In 2022, approximately 76%, 20% and 4% of Media Transactions Measured were for mobile devices, desktop devices, and emerging digital channels, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, 8% and 10% of our revenue, respectively, was generated from our supply-side customers to validate the quality of their ad inventory. We generate revenue from supply-side customers based on monthly or annual contracts with minimum guarantees and tiered pricing when guarantees are met. We believe that there are meaningful long-term growth opportunities within the digital advertising market. We plan to continue to invest in the development of new and premium solutions that increase our value proposition to customers and to extend our solutions capabilities to cover new and growing digital media environments, channels and devices, including CTV, new mobile apps and other emerging areas of digital ad spend. We plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing to grow our existing customer relationships and acquire new customers. In addition, we have completed six acquisitions since 2018 and maintain an active pipeline of potential M&A targets and intend to continue evaluating add-on opportunities to bolster our current solutions suite and complement our organic growth initiatives. Furthermore, we believe that there are significant long-term growth opportunities in markets outside of North America. We expect to continue to make investments in product development, sales and marketing, information technology, financial and administrative systems and controls to support our global growth. Factors Affecting Our Performance There are a number of factors that have impacted, and we believe will continue to impact, our results of operations and growth. These factors include: Significant Growth in Digital Ad Spend. Magna Global estimated that global digital ad spend, excluding search, reached over $280 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow to $386 billion by 2027. Our revenues have grown substantially as a result of the growth in digital advertising as well as the continued adoption of digital measurement solutions and analytics. As the digital advertising market has grown, advertisers have increasingly shifted their digital media spend to both programmatic and social media channels in order to directly target advertisements to achieve desired business outcomes. We have been direct beneficiaries of this growth by virtue of our integrations with leading programmatic and social media platforms. In the year ended December 31, 2023, the revenue we generated by providing our activation solutions through programmatic and social integrations and our measurement solutions through social integrations grew 31% and 48%, respectively, over the prior year period. In the year ended December 31, 2022, the revenue we generated by providing our activation solutions through programmatic and social integrations and our measurement solutions through social integrations grew 50% and 28%, respectively, over the prior year period. 48

Growth of Existing Customers. Our customers include many of the largest digital advertisers in the world and we have maintained exceptional customer retention with gross revenue retention rates of over 95% in each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. We define our gross revenue retention rate as the total prior year revenue earned from advertiser customers, less the portion of prior year revenue attributable to lost advertiser customers, divided by the total prior year revenue from advertiser customers, excluding a portion of our revenues that cannot be allocated to specific advertiser customers. Gross retention rates demonstrate strength in underlying business, recurring business profile, level of client satisfaction and lack of churn. We expect to continue to grow with our existing customers as they increase their spend on digital advertising and as we introduce new solutions across key channels, formats, devices and geographies. We have generated strong historical net revenue retention rates, with 124% for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 127% for the year ended December 31, 2022. We define our net revenue retention rate as the total current period revenue earned from advertiser customers, which were also customers during the entire most recent twelve-month period, divided by the total prior year period revenue earned from the same advertiser customers, excluding a portion of our revenues that cannot be allocated to specific advertiser customers. Net retention rates demonstrate strength in underlying business, recurring business profile, level of client satisfaction and lack of churn. Limitations for these metrics include limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure and the metrics not being the best indicator of our cash flows or future operating results.  You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on the Company’s GAAP results and using the non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally.; table: (row 0)

[570]: Table element - Text before table: We experience fluctuations in revenue that coincide with seasonal fluctuations in the digital ad spending of our customers. Advertisers typically allocate the largest portion of their media budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year in order to coincide with increased holiday purchasing. As a result, the fourth quarter of the year typically reflects our highest level of measurement of digital ads while the first quarter reflects the lowest level of such activity. We expect our revenue to continue to fluctuate based on seasonal factors that affect the advertising industry as a whole. While our revenue is highly recurring, seasonal fluctuations in ad spend may impact quarter-over-quarter results. We believe that the year-over-year comparison of results more appropriately reflects the overall performance of the business.

Management evaluates results of operations of the segments before certain corporate level costs and the effects of certain gains or losses not considered to be related to the core business operations. Management believes that this is a more meaningful representation of the operating performance of its core businesses, the profitability of operating segments, and the extent of cash flow generated from these core operations. Such amounts are presented under the caption “Other and Unallocated.” In the evaluation of operating segment results, management does not use any measures of total assets. This presentation is aligned with the management and operating structure of our company.

[372]: Table element - Text before table: Income taxes For the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded a $7.0 million income tax provision on a pretax loss of $71.1 million from continuing operations. The comparable amounts for 2022 were a $10.3 million income tax benefit on a pre-tax loss of $204.4 million. The income tax expense in 2023 includes a valuation allowance recorded for the operating losses in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions for which no income tax benefit was recorded, partially offset by a deferred tax benefit associated with a notional interest deduction carryforward at a foreign subsidiary.  The income tax benefit in 2022 includes deferred tax benefits associated with the asset impairment charges and related bad debt and inventory reserves, partially offset by a valuation allowance recorded for the operating losses in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions for which no income tax benefit was recorded .
Foreign Currency We own and operate facilities in Canada, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Spain and the Philippines. The functional currency of our Canadian operations is the U.S. dollar. However, in Germany, France and Spain it is the euro, in the UK, it is the British pound sterling, and in the Philippines the functional currency is the peso. On an annual basis, our euro denominated net sales exceeds euro expenses by an estimated €170 million. For 2023 compared to 2022, the average currency exchange rate of the euro strengthened relative to the U.S. dollar by approximately 2.6% , and the British pound sterling to the dollar strengthened by approximately 0.5%. With respect to the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, and Philippine peso, we have differing amounts of inflows and outflows of these currencies, although to a lesser degree than the euro. As a result, we are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates and such changes could be significant. The translation of the results from international operations into U.S. dollars is subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
The table below summarizes the translation impact on reported results that changes in currency exchange rates had on our non-U.S. based operations from the conversion of these operation’s results for the period indicated.; table: (row 0)

[718]: Table element - Text before table: Cost estimates Our remaining obligations under the OU1 consent decree consist of long-term monitoring and maintenance. Furthermore, we are primarily responsible for long-term monitoring and maintenance in OU2-OU4a over a period of at least 30 years. The monitoring activities consist of, among others, testing fish tissue, sampling water quality and sediment, and inspections of the engineered caps. In 2018, we entered into a fixed-price, 30-year agreement with a third party for the performance of all of our monitoring and maintenance obligations in OU1 through OU4a with limited exceptions, such as, for extraordinary amounts of cap maintenance or replacement. Our obligation under this agreement is included in our total reserve for the Site. We are obligated to make the regular payments under that fixed-price contract until the remaining amount due is less than the OU1 escrow account balance. We are permitted to pay for this contract using the remaining balance of the escrow account established by us and WTM I Company (“WTM I”) another PRP, under the OU1 consent decree during any period that the balance in the escrow account exceeds the amount due under our fixed-price contract. As of December 31, 2023, the escrow account balance, which is included in the consolidated balance sheet under the caption “Other assets” totaled $ 9.0 million which is less than amounts due under the fixed-price contract by approximately $ 0.9 million. Our obligation to pay this difference is secured by a letter of credit.
Under the consent decree, we are responsible for reimbursement of government oversight costs paid from October 2018 and later over approximately the next 30 years.

According to the table provided in fragment [335], the operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023, is $1,131,455. The currency used is USD, and the unit is millions. Therefore, the answer is formatted as a JSON object with the main question's value as 1,131,455, the currency as USD, and the unit as millions. The source of the information is fragment [335].","You are supposed to answer a question based on text fragments that are provided. The fragments start with a number in square brackets and then the actual text. The end of the fragment is shown by the same number in square brackets, only that the number is preceded by a slash. E.g. [22] Some Text [/22]. The lower the number of the fragment, the earlier the fragment appeared in the document (reading from left to right, top to bottom).  


                    The question is: What are the revenues for the 12 month period ending december 2023?  possible values: any number (positive or negative, including decimals)
 We also want to retrieve some meta information. In the following we will present the meta item ID and then the additional question to be answered, format: (META_ID): QUESTION.
(currency): What is the currency  possible values (select one from json array): ['USD', 'EUR', 'Other']
(unit): What is the unit?  possible values (select one from json array): ['none', 'thousands', 'millions', 'billions'] 

                    
                     


                    Your answer should be formatted as a JSON object. Under the key 'answers' can be one or more JSON object(s), with key value pairs for the main question and the meta items. For the main question use the key 'main_question', for the meta items use their ID as key. Under the key 'sources', you should also provide the numbers of the text fragments you used to answer the question. For example your answer could look like this: {""answers"": [{""main_question"": ""123"", ""currency"": ""USD"", ""unit"": ""none""}], ""sources"": [241, 423]} 

                    
                    This is the available data to answer the question (in the following, if tables have empty cells, they are omitted, if a cell spans several columns, values might be repeated for each cell):

[210]: Our operating revenue decreased $132.4 million, or 10.5%, to $1.131 billion in 2023 from $1.264 billion in 2022. Our operating revenue, net of fuel surcharges, decreased $81.4 million, or 7.7%, to $972.0 million in 2023 from $1.053 billion in 2022. This decrease in 2023 was due to a $38.9 million decrease in Brokerage revenue, a $24.6 million decrease in Intermodal revenue, net of fuel surcharges, a $15.9 million decrease in Truckload revenue, net of fuel surcharges, and a $2.0 million decrease in Dedicated revenue, net of fuel surcharges. Fuel surcharge revenue decreased to $159.4 million in 2023 from $210.4 million in 2022. [/210]

[463]: The following table sets forth for the years indicated our operating revenue and operating income by segment. We do not prepare separate balance sheets by segment and, as a result, assets are not separately identifiable by segment. [/463]
[465]: Truckload segment depreciation expense was $ 61.6 million, $ 56.4 million and $ 52.1 million, Dedicated segment depreciation expense was $ 46.2 million, $ 45.6 million and $ 43.0 million, Intermodal segment depreciation expense was $ 7.1 million, $ 7.5 million and $ 6.3 million, and Brokerage segment depreciation expense was $ 1.9 million, $ 1.5 million and $ 1.2 million, in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. [/465]
[466]: 52 [/466]
[468]: None. [/468]
[470]: As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2023. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We intend to periodically evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures as required by the Exchange Act Rules. [/470]
[226]: 23 [/226]
[227]: Gain on disposition of revenue equipment was $13.6 million in 2023, up slightly from $13.4 million in 2022 primarily due to an increase in the number of units sold, offset by a decrease in the average gain for our tractor and trailer sales. Future gains or losses on dispositions of revenue equipment will be impacted by the market for used revenue equipment, which is beyond our control. [/227]
[228]: Our operating income declined 37.1% to $90.1 million in 2023 from $143.3 million in 2022 as a result of the foregoing factors. Our operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, or “operating ratio,” was 92.0% in 2023 and 88.7% in 2022. The operating ratio for our Truckload segment was 94.7% in 2023 and 88.1% in 2022, for our Dedicated segment was 88.2% in each of 2023 and 2022, for our Intermodal segment was 100.2% in 2023 and 91.8% in 2022, and for our Brokerage segment was 89.7% in 2023 and 88.9% in 2022. Operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, with both amounts net of fuel surcharges, was 90.7% in 2023 and 86.4% in 2022. [/228]
[229]: Other non-operating income increased to $3.8 million from $827,000 in 2022 due to increased interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents. [/229]
[230]: Our effective income tax rate increased to 25.1% in 2023 from 23.5% in 2022 primarily due to increases in per diem and other non-deductible expenses. [/230]
[231]: As a result of the factors described above, net income declined 36.2% to $70.4 million, or $0.86 per diluted share, in 2023 from $110.4 million, or $1.35 per diluted share, in 2022. [/231]
[232]: 24 [/232]
[233]: Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2022 to Year Ended December 31, 2021 [/233]
[234]: The following table sets forth for the years indicated our operating revenue, operating income and operating ratio by segment, along with the change for each component: [/234]
[236]: Our operating revenue increased $290.2 million, or 29.8%, to $1.264 billion in 2022 from $973.6 million in 2021. Our operating revenue, net of fuel surcharges, increased $197.5 million, or 23.1%, to $1.053 billion in 2022 from $855.9 million in 2021. This increase in 2022 was due to a $65.2 million increase in Truckload revenue, net of fuel surcharges, a $60.1 million increase in Dedicated revenue, net of fuel surcharges, a $59.3 million increase in Brokerage revenue, and a $13.0 million increase in Intermodal revenue, net of fuel surcharges. Fuel surcharge revenue increased to $210.4 million in 2022 from $117.7 million in 2021 primarily due to higher fuel costs. [/236]
[368]: Segment reporting: We report our operating segments in accordance with accounting standards codified in FASB ASC 280, Segment Reporting . We have five current operating segments that are aggregated into four reporting segments (Truckload, Dedicated, Intermodal and Brokerage) for financial reporting purposes. See Note 14 for more information. [/368]
[369]: Use of estimates: We must make estimates and assumptions to prepare the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are primarily related to insurance and claims accruals and depreciation. Ultimate results could differ from these estimates. [/369]

[201]: This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes discussions of operating revenue, net of fuel surcharge revenue; Truckload, Dedicated and Intermodal revenue, net of fuel surcharge revenue; operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, each net of fuel surcharge revenue; and net fuel expense (fuel and fuel taxes net of fuel surcharge revenue and surcharges passed through to independent contractors, outside drayage carriers and railroads). We provide these additional disclosures because management believes these measures provide a more consistent basis for comparing results of operations from period to period. These financial measures in this report have not been determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Pursuant to Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K, we have included the amounts necessary to reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures of operating revenue, operating expenses divided by operating revenue, and fuel and fuel taxes.

The exercise of lease renewal options is at our sole discretion and is considered in the determination of the operating lease assets and lease liabilities once reasonably certain of exercise.
Management has elected to apply the short-term lease exemption to leases with an initial term of 12 months or less and these leases are not capitalized. This primarily affects drop yards and chassis, for which we recognize lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

[215]: Intermodal segment revenue decreased $37.7 million, or 29.0%, to $92.1 million in 2023 from $129.8 million in 2022. Intermodal segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, decreased 24.5% from 2022 primarily due to decreases in both our number of loads and our revenue per load. The operating ratio in 2023 increased to 100.2% from 91.8% in 2022. Impacting the 2023 operating ratio was a decrease in our revenue per load along with higher net fuel, company driver compensation, depreciation, maintenance, purchased transportation and chassis rental costs as a percentage of revenue. [/215]
[216]: Brokerage segment revenue decreased $38.9 million, or 19.0%, to $165.6 million in 2023 from $204.6 million in 2022 primarily due to decreases in both our revenue per load and our number of loads. The operating ratio in 2023 of 89.7% was up from 88.9% in 2022. This increase was due to higher costs across most areas of the segment, partially offset by a decrease in the amounts payable to carriers for transportation services which we arranged as a percentage of our Brokerage revenue.

Explanation:
The revenues for the 12 month period ending December 2023 can be found in the consolidated statement of operations table (fragment [732]). The revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023, is $881,662 thousand. Therefore, the revenue is 881,662 in thousands, the currency is USD, and the unit is thousands.","You are supposed to answer a question based on text fragments that are provided. The fragments start with a number in square brackets and then the actual text. The end of the fragment is shown by the same number in square brackets, only that the number is preceded by a slash. E.g. [22] Some Text [/22]. The lower the number of the fragment, the earlier the fragment appeared in the document (reading from left to right, top to bottom).  


                    The question is: What are the revenues for the 12 month period ending december 2023?  possible values: any number (positive or negative, including decimals)
 We also want to retrieve some meta information. In the following we will present the meta item ID and then the additional question to be answered, format: (META_ID): QUESTION.
(currency): What is the currency  possible values (select one from json array): ['USD', 'EUR', 'Other']
(unit): What is the unit?  possible values (select one from json array): ['none', 'thousands', 'millions', 'billions'] 

                    
                     


                    Your answer should be formatted as a JSON object. Under the key 'answers' can be one or more JSON object(s), with key value pairs for the main question and the meta items. For the main question use the key 'main_question', for the meta items use their ID as key. Under the key 'sources', you should also provide the numbers of the text fragments you used to answer the question. For example your answer could look like this: {""answers"": [{""main_question"": ""123"", ""currency"": ""USD"", ""unit"": ""none""}], ""sources"": [241, 423]}

Explanation:

The question asks for the revenues for the 12 month period ending December 2023. According to the table in fragment [610], the total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023, are $1,303,046 (in thousands). Therefore, the revenues in millions are 1.303046. The currency is USD, as indicated by the dollar sign ($) in the table. The unit is millions, as the revenues are presented in thousands and need to be converted to millions.

Meta information:

(currency): The currency is USD.
(unit): The unit is millions.","You are supposed to answer a question based on text fragments that are provided. The fragments start with a number in square brackets and then the actual text. The end of the fragment is shown by the same number in square brackets, only that the number is preceded by a slash. E.g. [22] Some Text [/22]. The lower the number of the fragment, the earlier the fragment appeared in the document (reading from left to right, top to bottom).  


                    The question is: What are the revenues for the 12 month period ending december 2023?  possible values: any number (positive or negative, including decimals)
 We also want to retrieve some meta information. In the following we will present the meta item ID and then the additional question to be answered, format: (META_ID): QUESTION.
(currency): What is the currency  possible values (select one from json array): ['USD', 'EUR', 'Other']
(unit): What is the unit?  possible values (select one from json array): ['none', 'thousands', 'millions', 'billions'] 

                    
                     


                    Your answer should be formatted as a JSON object. Under the key 'answers' can be one or more JSON object(s), with key value pairs for the main question and the meta items. For the main question use the key 'main_question', for the meta items use their ID as key. Under the key 'sources', you should also provide the numbers of the text fragments you used to answer the question. For example your answer could look like this: {""answers"": [{""main_question"": ""123"", ""currency"": ""USD"", ""unit"": ""none""}], ""sources"": [241, 423]}

[473]: Table element - Text before table: Occupancy costs include fixed rents, property taxes, common area maintenance charges, general liability insurance, contingent rents, and other property costs. In 2023, occupancy costs increased $3.9 million or 10 basis points as a percentage of revenue compared to 2022. This increase is primarily driven by an increase in fixed rents related to the sale-leaseback of 18 locations and the acquisition of five restaurants from a franchisee, mostly offset by reduced expenses related to net Company-owned restaurant closures.

The main question is answered with the total revenue for the 12 month period ending December 2023, which is $826,339. The currency is USD and the unit is thousands. The sources used to answer the question are the tables and text fragments with IDs 797, 627, 644, 645, 995, and 994.",n/a,"{""answers"": [{""main_question"": ""826,339"", ""currency"": ""USD"", ""unit"": ""thousands""}], ""sources"": [797, 627, 644]}"," {""answers"": [{""main_question"": 826339, ""currency"": ""USD"", ""unit"": ""thousands""}], ""sources"": [797]}","You are supposed to answer a question based on text fragments that are provided. The fragments start with a number in square brackets and then the actual text. The end of the fragment is shown by the same number in square brackets, only that the number is preceded by a slash. E.g. [22] Some Text [/22]. The lower the number of the fragment, the earlier the fragment appeared in the document (reading from left to right, top to bottom).  


                    The question is: What are the revenues for the 12 month period ending december 2023?  possible values: any number (positive or negative, including decimals)
 We also want to retrieve some meta information. In the following we will present the meta item ID and then the additional question to be answered, format: (META_ID): QUESTION.
(currency): What is the currency  possible values (select one from json array): ['USD', 'EUR', 'Other']
(unit): What is the unit?  possible values (select one from json array): ['none', 'thousands', 'millions', 'billions'] 

                    
                     


                    Your answer should be formatted as a JSON object. Under the key 'answers' can be one or more JSON object(s), with key value pairs for the main question and the meta items. For the main question use the key 'main_question', for the meta items use their ID as key. Under the key 'sources', you should also provide the numbers of the text fragments you used to answer the question. For example your answer could look like this: {""answers"": [{""main_question"": ""123"", ""currency"": ""USD"", ""unit"": ""none""}], ""sources"": [241, 423]}

The fragments start with a number in square brackets and then the actual text. The end of the fragment is shown by the same number in square brackets, only that the number is preceded by a slash. E.g. [22] Some Text [/22]. The lower the number of the fragment, the earlier the fragment appeared in the document (reading from left to right, top to bottom).  


                    The question is: What are the revenues for the 12 month period ending december 2023?  possible values: any number (positive or negative, including decimals)

(currency): What is the currency  possible values (select one from json array): ['USD', 'EUR', 'Other']
(unit): What is the unit?  possible values (select one from json array): ['none', 'thousands', 'millions', 'billions'] 

                    
                     


                    Your answer should be formatted as a JSON object. Under the key 'answers' can be one or more JSON object(s), with key value pairs for the main question and the meta items. For the main question use the key 'main_question', for the meta items use their ID as key. Under the key 'sources', you should also provide the numbers of the text fragments you used to answer the question. For example your answer could look like this: {""answers"": [{""main_question"": ""123"", ""currency"": ""USD"", ""unit"": ""none""}], ""sources"": [241, 423]} 

                    
                    This is the available data to answer the question (in the following, if tables have empty cells, they are omitted, if a cell spans several columns, values might be repeated for each cell):

[862]: Table element - Text before table: The Company discontinued its generic category of MYO in 2019 and its Zig-Zag branded
        MYO cigarette smoking tobacco in 2017. Thus, pending a change in MSA legislation, the Company has no remaining product lines covered by the MSA and will not be required to make future escrow deposits.
The Company has chosen to invest a portion of the MSA escrow, from time to time, in U.S. Government securities including TIPS, Treasury notes, and Treasury bonds. These
      investments are classified as available-for-sale and carried at fair value. Realized losses are prohibited under the MSA; thus, any investment with an unrealized loss position will be held until the value is recovered, or until maturity.
Fair values for the U.S. Governmental agency obligations are Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The following tables show cost and estimated fair value of the
        assets held in the MSA account, respectively, as well as the maturities of the U.S. Governmental agency obligations held in such account for the periods indicated.; table: (row 0)

[381]: Table element - Text before table: Specifically, we have presented adjusted net income attributable to ARC and adjusted earnings per share attributable to ARC stockholders for 2023 and 2022 to reflect the exclusion of the site remediation expense and changes in the valuation allowances related to certain deferred tax assets and other discrete tax items. This presentation facilitates a meaningful comparison of our operating results for 2023 and 2022. We believe these changes were the result of items which are not indicative of our actual operating performance.
We have presented adjusted EBITDA for 2023 and 2022 to exclude the site remediation expense as it is not indicative of our ongoing operations. We have presented adjusted EBITDA for 2023 and 2022 to also exclude stock-based compensation expense, as it is consistent with the definition of adjusted EBITDA in our Credit Agreement; therefore, we believe this information is useful to investors assessing our financial performance. We calculate adjusted EBITDA margin by dividing adjusted EBITDA by net sales.

The Company's current estimates of future environmental cleanup and remediation liabilities related to the site may change over time due to various factors, including but not limited to, the nature and extent of required future cleanup and removal activities, and the extent and duration of regulatory oversight, among other things. The final outcome of any regulatory inquiries and requirements cannot be predicted with certainty, and unfavorable or unexpected outcomes could result in additional costs that could be material to the Company's results of operations during any particular year of the remediation process. See Note 6, Commitments and Contingencies - Site Remediation Obligation within Part IV, Item 15 - ""Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K , for further discussion on this site remediation obligation.
Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the Company's customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company is expected to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company applied practical expedients related to unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which the Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it has the right to invoice for services performed.

The provisions of ASC 280, Segment Reporting , require public companies to report financial and descriptive information about their reportable operating segments. The Company identifies operating segments based on the various business activities that earn revenue and incur expense and whose operating results are reviewed by the Company's Chief Executive Officer, who is the Company's chief operating decision maker. Because its operating segments have similar products and services, classes of customers, production processes, distribution methods and economic characteristics, the Company operates as a single reportable segment.

Explanation:
The revenues for the 12 month period ending December 2023 are $794,632 (in thousands). The currency is USD, and the unit is thousands. This information is found in the table provided in fragment [805].","You are supposed to answer a question based on text fragments that are provided. The fragments start with a number in square brackets and then the actual text. The end of the fragment is shown by the same number in square brackets, only that the number is preceded by a slash. E.g. [22] Some Text [/22]. The lower the number of the fragment, the earlier the fragment appeared in the document (reading from left to right, top to bottom).  


                    The question is: What are the revenues for the 12 month period ending december 2023?  possible values: any number (positive or negative, including decimals)
 We also want to retrieve some meta information. In the following we will present the meta item ID and then the additional question to be answered, format: (META_ID): QUESTION.
(currency): What is the currency  possible values (select one from json array): ['USD', 'EUR', 'Other']
(unit): What is the unit?  possible values (select one from json array): ['none', 'thousands', 'millions', 'billions'] 

                    
                     


                    Your answer should be formatted as a JSON object. Under the key 'answers' can be one or more JSON object(s), with key value pairs for the main question and the meta items. For the main question use the key 'main_question', for the meta items use their ID as key. Under the key 'sources', you should also provide the numbers of the text fragments you used to answer the question. For example your answer could look like this: {""answers"": [{""main_question"": ""123"", ""currency"": ""USD"", ""unit"": ""none""}], ""sources"": [241, 423]}

[821]: Table element - Text before table: Regulatory balancing account revenue Regulatory balancing account revenue is revenue related to revenue mechanisms authorized in California by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), which the Company recognizes as revenue when it is objectively determinable, probable of recovery and expected to be collected within 24 months following the end of the accounting period. Regulatory balancing account revenues are not considered contracts with customers. To the extent that revenue is estimated to be collectible beyond 24 months, recognition is deferred. Due to a delay in resolution of Cal Water's most recent general rate case filing in July of 2021 (2021 GRC), the Company did not recognize a benefit from regulatory revenue mechanisms in 2023. For 2022, the Company's authorized regulatory revenue mechanisms included the Water Revenue Adjustment Mechanism (WRAM). The WRAM decoupled revenue from the volume of the sales and allowed the Company to recognize the adopted level of volumetric revenues. The variance between adopted volumetric revenues and actual billed volumetric revenues for metered accounts was recorded as regulatory balancing account revenue. The WRAM concluded on December 31, 2022. Regulatory balancing accounts also includes revenue that is recognized for balancing accounts when it is probable that future recovery of previously incurred costs or future refunds that are to be credited to customers will occur through the ratemaking process. These mechanisms, such as the Modified Cost Balancing Account (MCBA), Conservation Expense Balancing Account (CEBA), Pension Cost Balancing Account (PCBA), and Health Cost Balancing Account (HCBA), generally provide for recovery of the adopted levels of expenses for purchased water, purchased power, pump taxes, water conservation program costs, pensions, and health care. Variances between adopted and actual costs were recorded as regulatory balancing account revenue in 2022. In 2023, in connection with the CPUC's decision to discontinue the use of the WRAM, the variances for CEBA, HCBA, and PCBA are recorded against the originating expense. The MCBA concluded on December 31, 2022. The CPUC issued a decision effective August 27, 2020 requiring that Class A companies submitting GRC filings after the effective date be (i) precluded from proposing the use of a full decoupling WRAM in their next GRCs and (ii) allowed the use of a Monterey-Style Water Revenue Adjustment Mechanism (MWRAM). In addition, the CPUC's decision allowed for Incremental Cost Balancing Accounts (ICBAs) to replace the MCBA. The MWRAM tracks the difference between the revenue received for actual metered sales through the tiered volumetric rate and the revenue that would have been received with the same actual metered sales if a uniform rate had been in effect. The ICBA tracks differences between the authorized per-unit prices of water production costs and actual per-unit prices of water production costs. Cal Water complied with this decision in its 2021 GRC and the MWRAM and ICBAs will be effective retroactive to January 1, 2023 once approved. The Company did not record a regulatory asset or regulatory liability for the MWRAM or ICBAs for 2023. In September 2020, Cal Water filed an Application for Rehearing at the CPUC seeking to reverse the August 27, 2020 CPUC decision. In September 2021, the CPUC denied the Application for Rehearing. On or about October 27, 2021, Cal Water along with four other Class A California water utilities filed Petitions for a Writ of Review with the California Supreme Court (Court). On May 18, 2022, the Court issued writs granting review and ordered the CPUC and other filing parties to submit additional pleadings to the Court. The final pleadings were submitted on January 13, 2023. Cal Water anticipates that the Court will schedule an oral argument before it begins deliberations and issues its decision.

[829]: Table element - Text before table: Lease revenue is not considered revenue from contracts with customers and is recognized following operating lease standards. The Company is the lessor in operating lease agreements with telecommunications companies under which cellular phone antennas are placed on the Company's property. The Company provides the lessee the right to ingress and egress across lessor property to access the antennas. The minimum rents are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases, which may span multiple years. The excess rents are recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases and is included in a deferred receivable account in the accompanying balance sheet. The leases generally have terms of 5 to 10 years, with lessee options to extend the lease for up to 15 years. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the lessee’s sole discretion. Most of the Company’s lease agreements contain mutual termination options that require prior written notice by either lessee or lessor. A subset of the Company’s leases contains variable lease payments that depend on changes in the consumer price index (CPI).
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Generally, a lease agreement exists if the Company determines that the arrangement gives the lessee control over the use of an identified asset and obtains substantially all of the benefits from the identified asset.

[872]: Table element - Text before table: Note 12. Segments and Related Information
The Company has two reportable segments to align to its key geographies and go-to market strategy: North America (“NAM”) and Europe & Rest of World (“E&RW”). Operating segments have not been aggregated to form the reportable segments. The Company determined its reportable segments based on how the CODM reviews the Company’s operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. The CODM reviews net sales, gross profit and segment income for each of the reportable segments. Gross profit is defined as net sales less cost of sales incurred by the segment. The CODM does not evaluate reportable segments using asset information as these are managed on an enterprise-wide basis. Segment income is defined as segment gross profit less selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) and RD&E. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. The NAM segment manufactures and sells residential and commercial swimming pool equipment and supplies as well as equipment that controls the flow of fluids. This segment is composed of three reporting units. The E&RW segment manufactures and sells residential and commercial swimming pool equipment and supplies. This segment is composed of two reporting units. The Company sells its products primarily through distributors and retailers. Financial information by reportable segment is included in the following summary (in thousands):

U.K. We generally recognize revenue from our subscriptions ratably over the subscription term. Subscription terms generally range from thirty days to one year. Subscription revenue includes the transaction price allocated to bundled free trials for our subscription services and is net of promotional discounts, cancellations, sales allowances and credit reserves and payments to third-party service providers. For transaction and subscription revenue, we generally collect payments and fees at the time orders are placed and prior to services being rendered. We record amounts collected for services that have not been performed as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet. The transaction price that we record is generally based on the contractual amounts and is reduced for estimated sales allowances for price concessions, charge-backs, sales credits and refunds, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize.

Cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by $28.2 million mainly due to a $14.0 million increase in filing fees, a $4.2 million increase i n depreciation and amortization expense, a $2.8 million increase in third-party staffing fees, a $2.1 million increase in payroll and related benefits expense, and $1.4 million increase in stock-based compensation. The increase in filing fees was primarily driven by the increase in business formations during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 .

[593]: Table element - Text before table: Transaction revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased due to a 15% decrease in average order value compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, partially offset by a 12% increase in the number of transaction units over the same period. The decrease in average order value for the year ended December 31, 2023 was driven primarily by a 25% decrease in average order value related to our business formations due to the nationwide rollout of free LLC formations during the first quarter of 2023. The overall increase in transaction units during the year ended December 31, 2023 was due to a 23% increase in business formations due primarily to the nationwide rollout of free LLC formations. This increase was partially offset by a 12% reduction in estate planning transactions.
Subscription revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased primarily due to a 7% increase in the number of subscription units as of December 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022 and a 7% increase in ARPU compared to December 31, 2022. The increase in subscription units was driven primarily by a 4% increase in our registered agent and compliance subscription units, which was dampened by the exit of certain channel partner relationships in the back half of 2023. The increase in subscription units was also driven to a lesser extent by an increase in virtual mail, forms and e-signature subscriptions . ARPU increased 7% compared to December 31, 2022 driven primarily by a shift in the mix of our higher priced subscription offerings.

The main question is answered by looking at the table in fragment [477], where the net sales for the 12 month period ending December 2023 is $14,805.9 million.

Explanation:
The revenues for the 12 month period ending December 2023 are $1335.9 million. The currency is USD, and the unit is millions. The source for this information is the table in fragment [477].","You are supposed to answer a question based on text fragments that are provided. The fragments start with a number in square brackets and then the actual text. The end of the fragment is shown by the same number in square brackets, only that the number is preceded by a slash. E.g. [22] Some Text [/22]. The lower the number of the fragment, the earlier the fragment appeared in the document (reading from left to right, top to bottom).  


                    The question is: What are the revenues for the 12 month period ending december 2023?  possible values: any number (positive or negative, including decimals)
 We also want to retrieve some meta information. In the following we will present the meta item ID and then the additional question to be answered, format: (META_ID): QUESTION.
(currency): What is the currency  possible values (select one from json array): ['USD', 'EUR', 'Other']
(unit): What is the unit?  possible values (select one from json array): ['none', 'thousands', 'millions', 'billions'] 

                    
                     


                    Your answer should be formatted as a JSON object. Under the key 'answers' can be one or more JSON object(s), with key value pairs for the main question and the meta items. For the main question use the key 'main_question', for the meta items use their ID as key. Under the key 'sources', you should also provide the numbers of the text fragments you used to answer the question. For example your answer could look like this: {""answers"": [{""main_question"": ""123"", ""currency"": ""USD"", ""unit"": ""none""}], ""sources"": [241, 423]}

Answer: {""answers"": [{""main_question"": 2325768, ""currency"": ""USD"", ""unit"": ""thousands""}], ""sources"": [485]}","You are supposed to answer a question based on text fragments that are provided. The fragments start with a number in square brackets and then the actual text. The end of the fragment is shown by the same number in square brackets, only that the number is preceded by a slash. E.g. [22] Some Text [/22]. The lower the number of the fragment, the earlier the fragment appeared in the document (reading from left to right, top to bottom).  


                    The question is: What are the revenues for the 12 month period ending december 2023?  possible values: any number (positive or negative, including decimals)
 We also want to retrieve some meta information. In the following we will present the meta item ID and then the additional question to be answered, format: (META_ID): QUESTION.
(currency): What is the currency  possible values (select one from json array): ['USD', 'EUR', 'Other']
(unit): What is the unit?  possible values (select one from json array): ['none', 'thousands', 'millions', 'billions'] 

                    
                     


                    Your answer should be formatted as a JSON object. Under the key 'answers' can be one or more JSON object(s), with key value pairs for the main question and the meta items. For the main question use the key 'main_question', for the meta items use their ID as key. Under the key 'sources', you should also provide the numbers of the text fragments you used to answer the question. For example your answer could look like this: {""answers"": [{""main_question"": ""123"", ""currency"": ""USD"", ""unit"": ""none""}], ""sources"": [241, 423]}

In addition, the Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to those GAAP financial measures, provides investors with additional tools to understand the factors and trends affective the Company’s underlying business than could be obtained absent these disclosures.

Effects of Foreign Currency Translation
The Company’s foreign subsidiaries transact business and report financial results in their respective local currencies.  As a result, foreign subsidiary income statements are translated into U.S. dollars at average foreign exchange rates appropriate for the reporting period.  Because foreign exchange rates fluctuate against the U.S. dollar over time, foreign currency translation affects year-over-year comparisons of financial statement items (i.e., because foreign exchange rates fluctuate, similar year-over-year local currency results for a foreign subsidiary may translate into different U.S. dollar results).

[330]: Table element - Text before table: Net sales for European Polymer operations decreased $48.0 million, or 16 percent, year-over-year.  A 10 percent decrease in sales volume and lower average selling prices negatively impacted the change in net sales by $32.1 million and $24.7 million, respectively.  The decline in sales volume reflects customer and channel inventory destocking, reduced construction-related activities and customer share loss.  The lower average selling prices were primarily due to the pass-through of lower raw material costs and increased competitive activities.  Favorable foreign currency translation positively impacted the change in net sales by $8.8 million.  A weaker U.S. dollar relative to the Polish zloty led to the favorable foreign currency translation.
Net sales for Asian and Other operations decreased $0.3 million, or one percent.  Lower average selling prices and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation negatively impacted the year-over-year change in net sales by $5.2 million and $2.2 million, respectively.  A 16 percent increase in sales volume positively impacted the change in net sales by $7.1 million.  The higher sales volume reflects the loosening of COVID lockdowns and restrictions in China during the early part of 2023.
Polymer operating income for 2023 decreased $22.1 million, or 27 percent, versus operating income for 2022.

[341]: Table element - Text before table: Corporate Expenses
Corporate expenses, which include deferred compensation, business restructuring, asset/goodwill/other intangibles impairment charges and other operating expenses that are not allocated to the reportable segments, increased $17.8 million between years. Corporate expenses were $86.0 million in 2023 versus $68.2 million in 2022.  This increase was primarily attributable to $13.8 million of higher deferred compensation expense and a $12.7 million increase in business restructuring and asset/goodwill/other intangibles impairment expenses in 2023 versus 2022.  Partially offsetting these increases was a $10.5 million reduction in environmental remediation reserve expenses year over year.
The $13.8 million increased in deferred compensation expense was primarily due to an increase in the market values of mutual fund investment assets held for the plans in 2023 versus a decrease in 2022.  An $11.91 per share decrease in the market price of Company common stock during 2023 compared to a $17.83 per share decrease in 2022 also contributed to the year-over-year change.

[316]: Table element - Text before table: Net sales for Latin American operations decreased $58.9 million, or 16 percent, between years primarily due to lower average selling prices which negatively impacted the change in net sales by $91.0 million.  The lower average selling prices were primarily due to less favorable product mix, the pass-through of lower raw material costs and increased competitive activity within certain end-use markets.  Sales volume increased three percent and favorably impacted the change in net sales by $12.1 million.  The higher sales volume primarily reflects higher demand within the consumer products end markets that was partially offset by lower demand within the agricultural end markets due to significant customer and channel inventory destocking.  Foreign currency translation positively impacted the change in net sales by $20.0 million.  A weaker U.S. dollar relative to the Mexican peso and Brazilian real led to the favorable foreign currency translation.
Net sales for Asian Surfactant operations decreased $10.0 million, or 14 percent, year-over-year.

Deferred Compensation Plans
The accounting for the Company’s deferred compensation plans can cause period-to-period fluctuations in Company income and expenses.  Compensation expense is recognized when the value of Company common stock and mutual fund investment assets held for the plans increase, and compensation income is recognized when the value of Company common stock and mutual fund investment assets decline.

The answer to the main question is 361,051, which is the total revenue for the 12-month period ending December 2023. The currency is USD, and the unit is thousands. The sources of this information are tables [1179] and [1103].",n/a,"{""answers"": [{""main_question"": ""361,051"", ""currency"": ""USD"", ""unit"": ""thousands""}], ""sources"": [1179, 1103]}"," {""answers"": [{""main_question"": 361051, ""currency"": ""USD"", ""unit"": ""thousands""}], ""sources"": [1103]}","You are supposed to answer a question based on text fragments that are provided. The fragments start with a number in square brackets and then the actual text. The end of the fragment is shown by the same number in square brackets, only that the number is preceded by a slash. E.g. [22] Some Text [/22]. The lower the number of the fragment, the earlier the fragment appeared in the document (reading from left to right, top to bottom).  


                    The question is: What are the revenues for the 12 month period ending december 2023?  possible values: any number (positive or negative, including decimals)
 We also want to retrieve some meta information. In the following we will present the meta item ID and then the additional question to be answered, format: (META_ID): QUESTION.
(currency): What is the currency  possible values (select one from json array): ['USD', 'EUR', 'Other']
(unit): What is the unit?  possible values (select one from json array): ['none', 'thousands', 'millions', 'billions'] 

                    
                     


                    Your answer should be formatted as a JSON object. Under the key 'answers' can be one or more JSON object(s), with key value pairs for the main question and the meta items. For the main question use the key 'main_question', for the meta items use their ID as key. Under the key 'sources', you should also provide the numbers of the text fragments you used to answer the question. For example your answer could look like this: {""answers"": [{""main_question"": ""123"", ""currency"": ""USD"", ""unit"": ""none""}], ""sources"": [241, 423]} 

                    
                    This is the available data to answer the question (in the following, if tables have empty cells, they are omitted, if a cell spans several columns, values might be repeated for each cell):

Research and development expenses decreased primarily due to $17.4 million in lower scale-up expenses and $14.3 million in lower salaries and related expenses compared to the prior year, resulting from a lower headcount, partially offset by higher facility lease-related costs and approximately $1.0 million in incremental accelerated depreciation from planned write-offs and disposals of certain fixed assets associated with research and development resulting from our Global Operations Review.

[1061]: Table element - Text before table: The Company’s revenues are generated through sales of its products to distributors or customers. Revenue is recognized at the point in which the performance obligation under the terms of a contract with the customer have been satisfied and control has transferred. The Company’s performance obligation is typically defined as the accepted purchase order or the contract with the customer which requires the Company to deliver the requested products at agreed upon prices at the time and location of the customer’s choice. The Company generally does not offer warranties or a right to return on the products it sells except in the instance of a product recall or other limited circumstances. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for fulfilling the performance obligation. Sales and other taxes the Company collects concurrent with the sale of products are excluded from revenue. The Company's normal payment terms vary by the type and location of its customers and the products offered. The time between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. None of the Company's customer contracts as of December 31, 2023 contains a significant financing component. The Company routinely offers sales discounts and promotions through various programs to its customers and consumers. These programs include rebates, temporary on-shelf price reductions, off-invoice discounts, retailer advertisements, product coupons and other trade activities. Provision for discounts and incentives are recorded in the same period in which the related revenues are recognized. At the end of each accounting period, the Company recognizes a contra asset to accounts receivable for estimated sales discounts that have been incurred but not paid which totaled $ 6.9 million and $ 4.6 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The offsetting charge is recorded as a reduction of revenues in the same period when the expense is incurred. The Company recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets that the Company otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. The incremental cost to obtain contracts was not material.

[782]: Net Revenues [/782]
[784]: Net revenues in 2023 decreased $75.6 million, or 18.0%, as compared to the prior year driven by a 10.8% decrease in net revenue per pound and an 8.1% decrease in volume of products sold. The decrease in net revenue per pound was primarily driven by changes in product sales mix and increased trade discounts, partially offset by pricing changes and favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The decrease in volume of products sold primarily reflected weak category demand and the cycling of significant sell-in of Beyond Meat Jerky to TPP in 2022. Net revenues from sales of Beyond Meat Jerky to TPP were $5.3 million in 2023, as compared to $33.5 million in 2022. Net revenues from retail channel sales decreased 26.6% primarily due to higher trade discounts and reduced pricing, and lower overall demand as a result of a deceleration in growth of the plant-based meat category. Net revenues from foodservice channel sales increased 2.5%, primarily from international foodservice channel sales. [/784]

[822]: Table element - Text before table: Provision for taxes was $526 million and $573 million for the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, respectively, a decrease in income tax expense of $47 million. The decrease is primarily due to changes in income before taxes and tax reserve releases due to statute of limitation expirations. The decrease is offset by a reduction in our capacity to utilize foreign tax credits against U.S. foreign source income due to the increase in annual interest expense. As a result, we recorded a valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset related to future foreign tax credit benefits.

[1310]: Table element - Text before table: Cost Allocations from J&J Prior to Kenvue IPO
Prior to the Kenvue IPO, J&J provided significant support functions to the Company. The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect an allocation of these costs. Similarly, certain of the Company’s operations provided support to J&J’s affiliates and related costs for support are charged to J&J’s affiliates. Allocated costs included in Cost of sales in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations relate to enterprise-wide support primarily consisting of facilities, insurance, logistics, quality, and compliance which are predominantly allocated based on Net sales. Allocated costs included in SG&A expenses primarily relate to finance, human resources, benefits administration, procurement support, information technology, legal, corporate strategy, corporate governance, other professional services, and general commercial support functions and are predominantly allocated based on Net sales or headcount. See Note 1, “Description of the Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”.
Prior to Kenvue becoming a fully independent company, the allocations (excluding stock-based compensation expense), net of costs charged to J&J’s affiliates reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023, January 1, 2023, and January 2, 2022 were as follows:; table: (row 0)

Explanation:

The question asks for the revenues for the 12 month period ending December 2023. According to the table in fragment [547], the total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023, are $1,256,412 (in thousands). Therefore, the total revenues in millions of USD are 1,256.412.

The currency used in the financial statements is USD, as indicated by the ""$"" symbol. The unit used for the revenues is ""thousands,"" but since the question asks for the unit in millions, the answer is ""millions.""","You are supposed to answer a question based on text fragments that are provided. The fragments start with a number in square brackets and then the actual text. The end of the fragment is shown by the same number in square brackets, only that the number is preceded by a slash. E.g. [22] Some Text [/22]. The lower the number of the fragment, the earlier the fragment appeared in the document (reading from left to right, top to bottom).  


                    The question is: What are the revenues for the 12 month period ending december 2023?  possible values: any number (positive or negative, including decimals)
 We also want to retrieve some meta information. In the following we will present the meta item ID and then the additional question to be answered, format: (META_ID): QUESTION.
(currency): What is the currency  possible values (select one from json array): ['USD', 'EUR', 'Other']
(unit): What is the unit?  possible values (select one from json array): ['none', 'thousands', 'millions', 'billions'] 

                    
                     


                    Your answer should be formatted as a JSON object. Under the key 'answers' can be one or more JSON object(s), with key value pairs for the main question and the meta items. For the main question use the key 'main_question', for the meta items use their ID as key.

[1081]: Table element - Text before table: addition, Apache Midstream acquired Titus Oil and Gas, LLC (“Titus”) in October 2022, at which time Titus became a related party. Furthermore, in December 2023, Apache entered into an Underwriting Agreement to sell 7,475,000 shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock in a secondary offering. Apache owned less than 10 % of the Company’s issued and outstanding Common Stock after the sale.
Also, upon Closing of the Transaction, the Company acquired initial equity interests in Breviloba, GCX and EPIC, and an additional equity interest in PHP. Investments in these EMIs are accounted for using the equity investment method and are considered unconsolidated affiliates. The Company makes contributions, receives distributions and records equity in earnings or losses from these EMIs. See Note 7—Equity Method Investments in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for further information. In addition to equity investment activities, the Company pays a demand fee to PHP and a capacity fee to Breviloba for certain volumes transported on the Shin Oak pipeline.
The following table summarizes transactions with the above unconsolidated affiliates. Investment contributions, distributions and equity in earnings from EMIs are detailed in Note 7 — Equity Method Investments in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report, thus, not included in the table below.

[867]: As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, approximately 39 % and 65 %, respectively, of accounts receivable were derived from the above customers. All operating revenue derived from above customers are included in the Midstream Logistics segment. [/867]
[868]: Major Producers are defined as our producers who we gather natural gas, crude and/or produced water and process gas and dispose of produced water from and account for 10% or more of our cost of sales as presented in the consolidated financial statements. For the year ended December 31, 2023, approximately 60 % of the Company’s cost of sales were derived from three producers. For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 87 % of the Company’s cost of sales were derived from five producers. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 92 % of the Company’s cost of sales were derived from five producers. This concentration of producers may impact the Company's overall business risk, either positively or negatively, in that these entities may be similarly affected by changes in the economy or other conditions. We do not believe that a loss of revenues from any single customer would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. [/868]

[570]: Our revenue as historically been derived from our collaboration agreements, under which we may receive product sales revenue, royalties, and license fees, as well as development and sales milestones and other contingent payments. We recognize revenue when we transfer promised goods or services to our collaboration partners. [/570]
[571]: • Product sales and Cost of goods sold: Product sales include predominantly fixed price manufacturing and supply agreements with our collaboration partners and are the result of firm purchase orders from those partners. Accordingly, the revenue recognized in a given period is based solely on the demand and requirements of our collaboration partners and is not ratable throughout the year. We expect product sales to increase for 2024 as compared to 2023 due to increased demand from our partners with a corresponding increase in cost of goods sold. [/571]

[132]: Table of Contents For the Years Ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 We recognized a net loss of $62.6 million, $105.0 million and a net income of $179.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The net loss of $62.6 million and $105.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 included a non-cash gain of $1.5 million and a non-cash loss of $25.8 million from change in fair value derivative liabilities and convertible notes, respectively. The net income of $179.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 included a non-cash gain of $239.3 million from change in fair value derivative liabilities. Net cash used in operations was $53.6 million, $52.8 million and $38.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Research and development expense For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, research and development expense was $27.7 million, $35.5 million and $20.3 million, respectively. The increase in R&D in 2023 and 2022 as compared to 2021 was mainly reflected extensive one-time activities, which were started in mid of 2022 and fully completed as of December 31, 2023. The R&D expenses in 2023 and 2022 primarily reflected extensive one-time activities (i) to accomplish a number of pre-requisites that are required before making an application for regulatory of DCVax-L, (ii) to prepare the application package and (iii) to prepare other materials, such as the Trial Master File, to be inspection-ready in addition to the application package. The pre-requisites and preparations included developing, submitting and obtaining regulatory approval for a Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP), preparing and qualifying for manufacturing licenses required for the Sawston facility, completing the technology transfer from the London facility (where the Company had done all its manufacturing before 2022) to the Sawston facility to enable GMP manufacturing to begin in February 2022 at Sawston (while also continuing in the London facility), and six workstreams related to product matters involving Comparability, Stability, Potency, Product Profile, Mechanism of Action and Fill/Finish which are needed for the application package to seek regulatory approval of DCVax-L. The 2023 and 2022 R&D expenses we incurred for these activities included payments to numerous teams of specialized external consultants and the CRO, as well as to Advent BioServices. The majority of the payments to Advent were for one-time expenses for ten key one-time milestones for pre-requisites and preparations for the MAA application for product approval. These included three milestones for obtaining the three licenses required for the Sawston facility, six milestones for the six product workstreams, and 1 milestone related to preparing key portions of an application for regulatory approval of the DCVax-L product. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we completed the last three one-time milestones (obtaining a commercial manufacturing license from the MHRA, completion of drafting and submission of the application to MHRA for product approval), and recognized additional $1.5 million in research and development expense. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we paid $3.0 million for the cash component of seven milestones, and accrued $4.7 million for the cash component of future milestones. We issued 7.5 million shares at fair value of $5.9 million for the stock component of eight milestones, and we accrued $3.6 million for the stock component of future milestones. General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expenses were $29.7 million, $33.4 million and $33.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease of $3.6 million in 2023 compared to 2022 was mainly related to a decrease of $1.6 million in consulting, legal and professional fees, a decrease of $0.7 million in compensation expenses and a $0.9 million reduction in our director and officer insurance expenses. Expenses incurred in 2022 and 2021 were consistent with rounding, but there was a slight decrease of approximate $46,000 which was mainly related to a decrease of $7.0 million stock-based compensation that represented the vesting of a portion of previously granted equity-based awards, and that was recognized in general and administrative expense, and offset by an increase of approximately $1.8 million related to legal and professional expenses, an increase of $1.5 million in insurance premiums, an increase of $1.6 million related 29 [/132]

The key information used to answer the question:
- Fragment 661 shows the Statement of Operations table for Alcoa Corporation for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. The ""Sales"" row shows revenues of $10,551 million for 2023.
- Fragment 1051 also shows the Consolidated Statement of Operations, confirming the 2023 sales figure of $10,551 million.

The relevant row in the table is:

(col 1): $
(col 2): 10,551

Therefore, the revenues for the 12 month period ending December 2023 are $10,551 million.

The unit for the revenues is none, as the revenues are already provided in millions.

[661]: Table element - Text before table: The Consolidated Financial Statements of Alcoa Corporation are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). In accordance with GAAP, certain situations require management to make estimates based on judgments and assumptions, which may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. They also may affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management uses historical experience and all available information to make these estimates. Management regularly evaluates the judgments and assumptions used in its estimates, and results could differ from those estimates upon future events and their effects or new information.

[824]: Table element - Text before table: The Company generally leases its investment rental property to established tenants in the industrial, healthcare, restaurant, retail, and office property types. At December 31, 2023 , the Company had 796 real estate properties, 784 of which were leased under leases that have been classified as operating leases , nine that have been classified as direct financing leases, one that has been classified as a sales-type lease, and two that were vacant. Of the nine leases classified as direct financing leases , three include land portions which are accounted for as operating leases. The sales-type lease includes a land portion which is accounted for as an operating lease (see Revenue Recognition within Note 2). Most leases have initial terms of 10 to 20 years. The Company’s leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of fixed increases, increases in the CPI, or increases in the tenant’s sales volume. Generally, tenants are also required to pay all property taxes and assessments, substantially maintain the interior and exterior of the building, and maintain property and liability insurance coverage. The leases also typically provide for one or more multiple year renewal options, at the election of the tenant, and are subject to generally the same terms and conditions as the initial lease.

[780]: Table element - Text before table: Right-of-Use Assets and Lease Liabilities
The Company is a lessee under non-cancelable operating leases associated with its corporate headquarters and other office spaces as well as with leases of land (“ground leases”). The Company records right-of-use assets and lease liabilities associated with these leases. The lease liability is equal to the net present value of the future payments to be made under the lease, discounted using estimates based on observable market factors. The right-of-use asset is generally equal to the lease liability plus initial direct costs associated with the leases. The Company includes in the recognition of the right-of-use asset and lease liability those renewal periods that are reasonably certain to be exercised, based on the facts and circumstances that exist at lease inception. Amounts associated with percentage rent provisions are considered variable lease costs and are not included in the initial measurement of the right-of-use asset or lease liability. The Company has made an accounting policy election, applicable to all asset types, not to separate lease from nonlease components when allocating contract consideration related to operating leases.
Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities associated with operating leases were included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows:; table: (row 0)

[295]: Table of Contents EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ​ In 2023, we delivered high single digit sales growth as we continued strong pricing. Our strong pricing offset continued delivered product cost increases. Our team generated double-digit sales growth in Institutional & Specialty, high single digit sales growth in Industrial, and Other segments while Healthcare and Life Sciences generated good sales growth. Operating income grew by strong double digits, as strong pricing and cost savings initiatives overcame investments in the business and higher supply chain costs. ​ Sales ​ Reported sales increased 8% to $15.3 billion in 2023 from $14.2 billion in 2022. When measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange, fixed currency sales increased 8% compared to the prior year. Organic sales increased 9% compared to the prior year. ​ Gross Margin ​ Our reported gross margin was 40.2% of sales for 2023, compared to our 2022 reported gross margin of 37.8%. Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges included in cost of sales, our adjusted gross margin was 40.4% in 2023 and 38.2% in 2022. Our gross profit increased as our strong pricing exceeded delivered product cost inflation. ​ Operating Income ​ Reported operating income increased 28% to $2.0 billion in 2023, compared to $1.6 billion in 2022. Adjusted operating income, excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges increased 20% in 2023 as strong pricing overcame investments in the business including incentive compensation, unfavorable mix and higher supply chain costs. Organic operating income increased 20% in 2023. ​ Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Ecolab Per Common Share (“EPS”) ​ Reported diluted EPS increased 26% to $4.79 in 2023 compared to $3.81 in 2022. Special (gains) and charges had an impact on both years. Special (gains) and charges in 2023 were driven primarily by restructuring expense and 2022 was driven primarily by restructuring and pension settlement expense. Adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes the impact of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items increased 16% to $5.21 in 2023 compared to $4.49 in 2022 as our strong operating income performance was partially offset by foreign currency translation and increases in interest expense. ​ Balance Sheet ​ We remain committed to maintaining “A” range ratings metrics over the long-term, supported by our current credit ratings of A-/A3/A- by Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s Investor Services and Fitch, respectively. Our strong balance sheet has allowed us continued access to capital at attractive rates. ​ Cash Flow ​ Cash flow from operating activities was $2.4 billion in 2023 compared to $1.8 billion in 2022. We continued to generate strong cash flow from operations, allowing us to fund our ongoing operations, investments in our business, acquisitions, debt repayments, pension obligations and return cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments. ​ Dividends ​ Dividends declared per common share in 2023 was $2.16 per share. In December 2023 we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 8% to $0.57 per share, representing our 32 nd consecutive annual dividend rate increase. We have paid cash dividends on our common shares for 87 consecutive years. Our outstanding dividend history reflects our long-term growth and development, strong cash flows, solid financial position and confidence in our business prospects for the years ahead. ​ ​ 26 [/295]

Explanation:

The revenues for the 12 month period ending December 2023 can be found in the table provided in fragment [702]. The table shows the consolidated statements of operations for Main Street Capital Corporation. The relevant line item is ""Net increase in net assets resulting from operations,"" which is the sum of net investment income, net realized gain (loss), and net unrealized appreciation (depreciation). For the year ended December 31, 2023, this value is $428,447,000.

The currency used in the financial statements is USD, as indicated by the dollar signs ($) used throughout the table.

The unit used in the financial statements is millions, as indicated by the note at the top of the table: ""dollars in thousands, except shares and per share amounts."" Since the value provided is in thousands, we can infer that the unit is millions.

Therefore, the answers to the main question and the meta items are as follows:

- Main question: The revenues for the 12 month period ending December 2023 are $428,447,000.
- Currency: USD
- Unit: millions

The sources used to answer the question are the table in fragment [702].","You are supposed to answer a question based on text fragments that are provided. The fragments start with a number in square brackets and then the actual text. The end of the fragment is shown by the same number in square brackets, only that the number is preceded by a slash. E.g. [22] Some Text [/22]. The lower the number of the fragment, the earlier the fragment appeared in the document (reading from left to right, top to bottom).  


                    The question is: What are the revenues for the 12 month period ending december 2023?  possible values: any number (positive or negative, including decimals)
 We also want to retrieve some meta information. In the following we will present the meta item ID and then the additional question to be answered, format: (META_ID): QUESTION.
(currency): What is the currency  possible values (select one from json array): ['USD', 'EUR', 'Other']
(unit): What is the unit?  possible values (select one from json array): ['none', 'thousands', 'millions', 'billions'] 

                    
                     


                    Your answer should be formatted as a JSON object. Under the key 'answers' can be one or more JSON object(s), with key value pairs for the main question and the meta items. For the main question use the key 'main_question', for the meta items use their ID as key. Under the key 'sources', you should also provide the numbers of the text fragments you used to answer the question. For example your answer could look like this: {""answers"": [{""main_question"": ""123"", ""currency"": ""USD"", ""unit"": ""none""}], ""sources"": [241, 423]}

[551]: Table element - Text before table: Distributable net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased 39% to $356.8 million, or $4.36 per share, compared with $257.5 million, or $3.46 per share, in 2022. The increase in distributable net investment income was primarily due to the increased level of total investment income, partially offset by higher operating expenses, excluding the impact of share-based compensation expense and deferred compensation expense (benefit), both as discussed above. The increase in distributable net investment income per share also reflects the impact of the increase in weighted-average shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2023 as discussed above. The increase in distributable net investment income on a per share basis includes a $0.15 per share increase in investment income considered less consistent or non-recurring, as discussed above.

[1283]: Table element - Text before table: On March 9, 2023, the Company completed a follow-on offering (the ""March Offering"") under its shelf registration statement, issuing 6,500,000 shares of its common stock at a price to the underwriters of $ 15.09 per share. Net of offering and underwriting costs, the Company received cash proceeds of $ 97,578 .
Distributions
The Company has adopted a DRIP that provides for the automatic reinvestment of all cash distributions declared by the Board of Directors unless a stockholder elects to “opt out” of the DRIP. As a result, if the Board of Directors declares a cash distribution, then the stockholders who have not “opted out” of the DRIP will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of common stock, rather than receiving the cash distribution. The shares distributed by the Transfer Agent in the Company’s DRIP are either through (i) newly issued shares or (ii) acquired by the Transfer Agent through the purchase of outstanding shares on the open market. If, on the payment date for any distribution, the most recently computed NAV per share as of the DRIP is equal to or less than the closing market price plus estimated per share fees, the Transfer Agent will invest the distribution amount in newly issued shares. Otherwise, the Transfer Agent will invest the dividend amount in shares acquired by purchasing shares on the open market.
