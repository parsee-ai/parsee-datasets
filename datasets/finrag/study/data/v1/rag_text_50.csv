[473]: Table element - Text before table: Occupancy costs include fixed rents, property taxes, common area maintenance charges, general liability insurance, contingent rents, and other property costs. In 2023, occupancy costs increased $3.9 million or 10 basis points as a percentage of revenue compared to 2022. This increase is primarily driven by an increase in fixed rents related to the sale-leaseback of 18 locations and the acquisition of five restaurants from a franchisee, mostly offset by reduced expenses related to net Company-owned restaurant closures.

[473]: Table element - Text before table: Occupancy costs include fixed rents, property taxes, common area maintenance charges, general liability insurance, contingent rents, and other property costs. In 2023, occupancy costs increased $3.9 million or 10 basis points as a percentage of revenue compared to 2022. This increase is primarily driven by an increase in fixed rents related to the sale-leaseback of 18 locations and the acquisition of five restaurants from a franchisee, mostly offset by reduced expenses related to net Company-owned restaurant closures.

In 2023, occupancy costs increased $3.9 million or 10 basis points as a percentage of revenue compared to 2022. This increase is primarily driven by an increase in fixed rents related to the sale-leaseback of 18 locations and the acquisition of five restaurants from a franchisee, mostly offset by reduced expenses related to net Company-owned restaurant closures.

[437]: INCOME TAXES The Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities for taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets for deductible temporary differences and operating loss carry‑forwards using enacted tax rates in effect in the years the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax benefit or expense is recognized as a result of changes in net deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some or all of any deferred tax assets will not be realized.
[438]: CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents include short-term investments, which are highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased.
[439]: 34
[440]: INVENTORY Inventory is stated at the lower of cost (based on the first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. Cost of product includes shipping and handling fees. The Company estimates losses from obsolete or slow-moving inventory and reserves the cost of inventory at the time such determinations are made. Expense associated with inventory reserves is recognized in cost of sales.
[319]: Table element - Text before table: Noncontrolling interest represents the share of net earnings or loss that is attributable to our joint venture partners. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest increased $48.0 million to $104.1 million as compared to $56.1 million in the prior year, primarily due to higher earnings by our joint ventures, predominantly in China.

[358]: Business Combinations. We use the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations and recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed measured at their fair values on the date acquired. Goodwill is measured as of the acquisition date as the excess of consideration transferred over the net acquisition date fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The valuation of identifiable intangible assets reflects management's estimates based on, among other factors, use of established valuation methods, including, but not limited to, the multi-period excess earnings method income approach. Further estimates within these models include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows, including revenues and expenses, and applicable discount rates. These estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be recorded, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).

On April 17, 2009, Cal Water (Issuer) issued $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.500% First Mortgage Bonds due 2040, all of which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company (Guarantor). Certain subsidiaries of the Company do not guarantee the security and are referred to as Non-guarantors. The Guarantor fully, absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees the due and punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, by notice of prepayment or otherwise, of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the bonds. The bonds rank equally among Cal Water's other first mortgage bonds.
The following tables present summarized financial information of the Issuer subsidiary and the Guarantor. The information presented below excludes eliminations necessary to arrive at the information on a consolidated basis. In presenting the summarized financial statements, the equity method of accounting has been applied to the Guarantor interests in the Issuer.

The fragments start with a number in square brackets and then the actual text. The lower the number of the fragment, the earlier the fragment appeared in the document (reading from left to right, top to bottom).  


                    The question is: What are the revenues for the 12 month period ending december 2023?  possible values: any number (positive or negative, including decimals)
 We also want to retrieve some meta information. In the following we will present the meta item ID and then the additional question to be answered, format: (META_ID): QUESTION.
(currency): What is the currency  possible values (select one from json array): ['USD', 'EUR', 'Other']
(unit): What is the unit?  possible values (select one from json array): ['none', 'thousands', 'millions', 'billions'] 

                    
                     


                    Your answer should be formatted as a JSON object. Under the key 'answers' can be one or more JSON object(s), with key value pairs for the main question and the meta items. For the main question use the key 'main_question', for the meta items use their ID as key. Under the key 'sources', you should also provide the numbers of the text fragments you used to answer the question. For example your answer could look like this: {""answers"": [{""main_question"": ""123"", ""currency"": ""USD"", ""unit"": ""none""}], ""sources"": [241, 423]} 

                    
                    This is the available data to answer the question (in the following, if tables have empty cells, they are omitted, if a cell spans several columns, values might be repeated for each cell):

Regulatory balancing account revenues are not considered contracts with customers. To the extent that revenue is estimated to be collectible beyond 24 months, recognition is deferred. Due to a delay in resolution of Cal Water's most recent general rate case filing in July of 2021 (2021 GRC), the Company did not recognize a benefit from regulatory revenue mechanisms in 2023. For 2022, the Company's authorized regulatory revenue mechanisms included the Water Revenue Adjustment Mechanism (WRAM). The WRAM decoupled revenue from the volume of the sales and allowed the Company to recognize the adopted level of volumetric revenues. The variance between adopted volumetric revenues and actual billed volumetric revenues for metered accounts was recorded as regulatory balancing account revenue. The WRAM concluded on December 31, 2022. Regulatory balancing accounts also includes revenue that is recognized for balancing accounts when it is probable that future recovery of previously incurred costs or future refunds that are to be credited to customers will occur through the ratemaking process.

[545]: TABLE OF CONTENTS
[546]: the entity’s economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity or right to receive benefits from the entity that could be potentially significant to the VIE is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the VIE. In accordance with ASC 810, the Company performs ongoing reassessments of whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The financial statements of the VIEs for which the Company is considered to be the primary beneficiary, if any, are consolidated in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The noncontrolling interests attributable to other beneficiaries of the VIEs are included as noncontrolling interests in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Property and Equipment, Net Property and equipment, net are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives of assets range from 1 to 15 years. Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Earnest Money Deposits In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into land and lot option contracts to procure land for the construction of homes in the future. Pursuant to these option contracts, the Company generally provides a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future, usually at predetermined prices. Such contracts enable the Company to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties or unconsolidated entities until the Company has determined whether and when to exercise its option, which reduces the Company’s financial risk associated with long-term land holdings. Option deposits and pre-acquisition costs (such as environmental testing, surveys, engineering, and entitlement costs) are capitalized if the costs are directly identifiable with the land under option and acquisition of the property is probable. These costs are reclassified to inventory upon taking title to the land. The Company writes off deposits and pre-acquisition costs if it becomes probable that the Company will not proceed with the project or recover the capitalized costs. Such decisions take into consideration changes in local market conditions, the timing of required land takedowns, the availability and best use of necessary incremental capital, and other factors. Under ASC 810, a non-refundable deposit paid to an entity is deemed to be a variable interest that will absorb some or all of the entity’s expected losses if they occur and, as such, the Company’s land and lot option contracts are considered variable interests. The Company’s option contract deposits along with any related pre-acquisition costs represent the Company’s maximum exposure to the land seller if the Company elects not to purchase the optioned property. Therefore, whenever the Company enters into an option or purchase contract with an entity and makes a non-refundable deposit, a VIE assessment is performed. However, the Company generally has little control or power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance due to the Company’s lack of an equity interest in them. Additionally, creditors of the VIE typically have no material recourse against the Company, and the Company does not provide financial or other support to these VIEs other than as stipulated in the option contracts. In accordance with ASC 810, the Company performs ongoing reassessments of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Intangible Assets Intangible assets, net consists of the estimated fair value of the acquired trade name, net of amortization. The trade name has a definite life and is amortized over ten years. Intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The impairment loss recorded would be the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value would be determined using a discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation technique. Goodwill The excess of the purchase price of a business acquisition over the net fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is capitalized as goodwill in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). The allocation to goodwill

For the main question use the key 'main_question', for the meta items use their ID as key. Under the key 'sources', you should also provide the numbers of the text fragments you used to answer the question.

[872]: Table element - Text before table: Note 12. Segments and Related Information
The Company has two reportable segments to align to its key geographies and go-to market strategy: North America (“NAM”) and Europe & Rest of World (“E&RW”). Operating segments have not been aggregated to form the reportable segments. The Company determined its reportable segments based on how the CODM reviews the Company’s operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. The CODM reviews net sales, gross profit and segment income for each of the reportable segments. Gross profit is defined as net sales less cost of sales incurred by the segment. The CODM does not evaluate reportable segments using asset information as these are managed on an enterprise-wide basis. Segment income is defined as segment gross profit less selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) and RD&E. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. The NAM segment manufactures and sells residential and commercial swimming pool equipment and supplies as well as equipment that controls the flow of fluids. This segment is composed of three reporting units. The E&RW segment manufactures and sells residential and commercial swimming pool equipment and supplies. This segment is composed of two reporting units. The Company sells its products primarily through distributors and retailers. Financial information by reportable segment is included in the following summary (in thousands):

[480]: Gross profit margin is gross profit as a percentage of net sales. Gross profit margin is impacted by costs of raw material, product mix, salary and wage inflation, production costs, shipping and handling costs, and import duties, all of which can vary.
[481]: Selling, general and administrative expense
[482]: Our SG&A includes expenses arising from activities in selling, marketing, technical and customer services, warranty, warehousing, and administrative expenses. Other than warranty and variable compensation, SG&A is generally not directly proportional to net sales.
[483]: Research, development and engineering expense
[484]: The Company conducts RD&E activities in its own facilities. These expenses consist primarily of salaries, supplies and overhead costs related to the active development of new products, enhanced product applications and improved manufacturing and value engineering of existing products.
[485]: Generally, RD&E costs are expensed as incurred. Certain RD&E costs applicable to the development of software are capitalized and amortized over the expected life of the product.
[705]: Revenue Recognition
[706]: As described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company primarily sells pool equipment to its customers. The Company’s consolidated net sales were $992.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. An arrangement with a customer contains a single performance obligation for sale of the products. Transfer of the individual product is considered the performance obligation. The Company ships its products via Free on Board (FOB) shipping point and recognizes revenue at the point-in-time of shipment to the customer. The Company recognizes revenue net of rebates and other discounts.
[707]: The principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition is a critical audit matter is a high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures related to the Company’s revenue recognition. Also, as disclosed by management, material weaknesses existed during the year related to the Company’s control environment, control activities, and information technology general controls, which impacted this matter.

[551]: (Dollars in thousands)
[553]: (a) See “—Non-GAAP Reconciliation.”
[554]: Year-over-year net sales decrease was driven by the following:
[556]: Net sales
[557]: Net sales decreased to $823.3 million in Fiscal Year 2023 from $1,108.9 million in Fiscal Year 2022, a decrease of $285.6 million or 25.8%.
[558]: This decrease was primarily the result of a decline in volume, partially offset by increases in price and the favorable impact of acquisitions. The decline in volume was primarily the result of the moderation of end market demand trends due to macroeconomic factors and distribution channel destocking. The increase in the net price was due to price increases enacted to offset inflation.
[559]: Gross profit and Gross profit margin
[560]: Gross profit decreased to $410.6 million in Fiscal Year 2023 from $514.9 million in Fiscal Year 2022, a decrease of $104.3 million or 20.2%.
[561]: Gross profit margin increased to 49.9% in Fiscal Year 2023 from 46.4% in Fiscal Year 2022, an increase of 350 basis points, primarily due to the management of our manufacturing costs, including reduced costs specifically in freight and tariffs, partially offset by lower operating leverage.
[592]: Use of the terms EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, total segment income, adjusted segment income and adjusted segment income margin may differ from similar measures reported by other companies. EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, total segment income, adjusted segment income and adjusted segment income margin are not calculated in the same manner by all companies, and accordingly, are not necessarily comparable to similarly entitled measures of other companies and may not be an appropriate measure for performance relative to other companies. EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, total segment income and adjusted segment income should not be construed as indicators of a company’s operating performance in isolation from, or as a substitute for, net income (loss), operating income and segment income, which are prepared in accordance with GAAP. We have presented EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, total segment income, adjusted segment income and adjusted segment income margin solely as supplemental disclosure because we believe it allows for a more complete analysis of results of operations. In the future we may incur expenses such as those added back to calculate adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted segment income should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by these items.
[486]: Amortization of intangible assets
[487]: Customer relationships, trademarks and other intangible assets arising from business combinations are amortized over their expected useful lives of 5-20 years.
[488]: Acquisition and restructuring related costs (or income)
[489]: The Company records costs or expenses incurred related to business combinations, organizational restructuring, or gains or losses attributable to any sales or dispositions of assets, including impairments, to acquisition and restructuring related expense, net.
[490]: Operating income
[491]: Operating income is gross profit less SG&A, RD&E, acquisition and restructuring related expense or income and amortization of intangible assets. Operating income excludes interest expense, income tax expense, and other non-operating expenses, net. We use operating income as well as other indicators as a measure of the profitability of our business.
[492]: 38
[493]: Interest expense, net
[494]: The Company incurs interest expense on its Credit Facilities, as defined herein. The amortization of debt issuance costs and impact of our interest rate hedging instruments are also included in interest expense.
[475]: Net sales
[476]: We offer a broad range of pool equipment including pumps, filters, heaters, automatic cleaners, sanitizers, controls, LED lights, as well as industrial thermoplastic valves and process liquid control products. Sales are impacted by product and geographic segment mix, as well as promotional and competitive activities. Growth of our sales is primarily driven by market demand, expansion of our trade customers and product offering.
[477]: Revenue is recognized upon shipment and recorded net of related discounts, allowances, returns, and sales tax. Customers are offered volume discounts and other promotional benefits. We estimate these volume discounts, promotional allowance benefits, and returns based upon the terms of the customer contracts and historical experience and record such amounts as a reduction of gross sales with an offsetting adjustment to account receivable. We regularly monitor the adequacy of these allowances.
[478]: Gross profit and gross profit margin
[479]: Gross profit is equal to net sales less cost of sales. Cost of sales includes the direct cost of manufacturing, including direct materials, labor and related overhead, as well as inbound and outbound freight and import duties.
[117]: Segments
[118]: We operate in a global pool equipment market with an installed base that we estimate to be approximately 25 million pools globally. North America and Europe are the two largest pool markets, accounting for an estimated 68% of the total global installed base and 84% of total equipment sales according to market studies.
[119]: Our business is organized into two reportable segments: North America (“NAM”) and Europe & Rest of World (“E&RW”). We determined our operating segments based on how the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) reviews the Company’s operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. NAM and E&RW accounted for approximately 83% and 17% and 84% and 16% of total net sales for Fiscal Year 2023 and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 (“Fiscal Year 2022”), respectively. For financial information with respect to our business segments, see Item 7 . “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and Note 12 . “Segments and Related Information” of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in
[571]: Table element - Text before table: Adjusted segment income margin decreased to 28.9% in Fiscal Year 2023 from 30.7% in Fiscal Year 2022, a decrease of 180 basis points.

[872]: Table element - Text before table: Note 12. Segments and Related Information
The Company has two reportable segments to align to its key geographies and go-to market strategy: North America (“NAM”) and Europe & Rest of World (“E&RW”). Operating segments have not been aggregated to form the reportable segments. The Company determined its reportable segments based on how the CODM reviews the Company’s operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. The CODM reviews net sales, gross profit and segment income for each of the reportable segments. Gross profit is defined as net sales less cost of sales incurred by the segment. The CODM does not evaluate reportable segments using asset information as these are managed on an enterprise-wide basis. Segment income is defined as segment gross profit less selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) and RD&E. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. The NAM segment manufactures and sells residential and commercial swimming pool equipment and supplies as well as equipment that controls the flow of fluids. This segment is composed of three reporting units. The E&RW segment manufactures and sells residential and commercial swimming pool equipment and supplies. This segment is composed of two reporting units. The Company sells its products primarily through distributors and retailers. Financial information by reportable segment is included in the following summary (in thousands):

[872]: Table element - Text before table: Note 12. Segments and Related Information
The Company has two reportable segments to align to its key geographies and go-to market strategy: North America (“NAM”) and Europe & Rest of World (“E&RW”). Operating segments have not been aggregated to form the reportable segments. The Company determined its reportable segments based on how the CODM reviews the Company’s operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. The CODM reviews net sales, gross profit and segment income for each of the reportable segments. Gross profit is defined as net sales less cost of sales incurred by the segment. The CODM does not evaluate reportable segments using asset information as these are managed on an enterprise-wide basis. Segment income is defined as segment gross profit less selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) and RD&E. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. The NAM segment manufactures and sells residential and commercial swimming pool equipment and supplies as well as equipment that controls the flow of fluids. This segment is composed of three reporting units. The E&RW segment manufactures and sells residential and commercial swimming pool equipment and supplies. This segment is composed of two reporting units. The Company sells its products primarily through distributors and retailers. Financial information by reportable segment is included in the following summary (in thousands):

[872]: Table element - Text before table: Note 12. Segments and Related Information
The Company has two reportable segments to align to its key geographies and go-to market strategy: North America (“NAM”) and Europe & Rest of World (“E&RW”). Operating segments have not been aggregated to form the reportable segments. The Company determined its reportable segments based on how the CODM reviews the Company’s operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. The CODM reviews net sales, gross profit and segment income for each of the reportable segments. Gross profit is defined as net sales less cost of sales incurred by the segment. The CODM does not evaluate reportable segments using asset information as these are managed on an enterprise-wide basis. Segment income is defined as segment gross profit less selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) and RD&E. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. The NAM segment manufactures and sells residential and commercial swimming pool equipment and supplies as well as equipment that controls the flow of fluids. This segment is composed of three reporting units. The E&RW segment manufactures and sells residential and commercial swimming pool equipment and supplies. This segment is composed of two reporting units. The Company sells its products primarily through distributors and retailers. Financial information by reportable segment is included in the following summary (in thousands):

[1258]: Segment Reporting We operate in a single segment, which is to provide capital return to stockholders by maximizing the potential value of our portfolio of royalties and innovative healthcare assets. Our Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) is our Chief Executive Officer. The CODM allocates resources and evaluates the performance of Innoviva at the consolidated level using information about our revenues, operating results and other key financial data as needed. Our revenues are generated primarily from our collaborative arrangements and royalty payments from GSK, located in Great Britain. We also generate revenue from net product sales of GIAPREZA ® , XERAVA ® , and XACDURO ® . Refer to Note 3, “Revenue Recognition”, for more information on our revenues for the periods presented. Our long-term assets are located within the United States.

[1260]: Variable Interest Entities The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (“VIE”) is required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the VIE. When we obtain a variable interest in another entity, we assess at the inception of the relationship and upon occurrence of certain significant events whether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE based on our power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and our obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. To assess whether we have the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, we consider all the facts and circumstances, including our role in establishing the VIE and our ongoing rights and responsibilities. This assessment includes identifying the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and identifying which party, if any, has power over those activities. In general, the parties that make the most significant decisions affecting the VIE (management and representation on the Board of Directors) and have the right to unilaterally remove those decision-makers are deemed to have the power to direct the activities of a VIE. To assess whether we have the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE, we consider all of our economic interests that are deemed to be variable interests in the VIE. This assessment requires us to apply judgment in determining whether these interests, in the aggregate, are considered potentially significant to the VIE.

[1020]: Financial Highlights
[1021]: • Royalty revenue: Fourth quarter 2023 gross royalty revenue from GSK was $69.6 million and full year was $252.7 million, compared to $54.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2022 and $253.4 million for the full year 2022.
[1022]: 78
[1023]: Table of Contents
[1024]: • Net Product Sales: Fourth quarter 2023 net product sales and license revenue were $19.7 million, which included $13.1 million from GIAPREZA ® , $5.2 million from XERAVA ® , and $1.4 million from XACDURO ® , compared to $14.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Full year 2023 net product sales and license revenue was $71.6 million, which included $41.3 million from GIAPREZA ® , $17.3 million from XERAVA ® , $2.0 million from XACDURO ® , and $11.0 million in milestone payments from our partners.
[1025]: • Equity and long-term investments: Fourth quarter and full year 2023 change in fair values of equity and long-term investments of $25.5 million and $88.5 million, respectively, was primarily attributable to Armata share price appreciation.
[1102]: Total royalty revenue, net, decreased to $311.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in total net royalty revenue was primarily due to the sale of our ownership interest in TRC, which received royalties stemming from sales of TRELEGY ® ELLIPTA ® . Royalties for RELVAR ® /BREO ® ELLIPTA ® and ANORO ® ELLIPTA ® decreased due to pricing pressures in the U.S. market and foreign currency rate changes.
[1103]: Net Product Sales
[1104]: Net product sales for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $60.6 million, consisting of net sales of GIAPREZA ® , XERAVA ® and XACDURO ® for $41.3 million, $17.3 million, and $2.0 million, respectively. We derived approximately 91% of our net product sales for the same period from customers located in the U.S. and 9% from the rest of the world.
[1105]: Net product sales we recognized from the date of acquisition of La Jolla, which occurred on August 22, 2022, to December 31, 2022 was $19.7 million, consisting of net sales of GIAPREZA ® and XERAVA ® for $14.2 million and $5.5 million, respectively. We derived approximately 96% of our net product sales for the same period from customers located in the U.S. and 4% from the rest of the world.

The lower the number of the fragment, the earlier the fragment appeared in the document (reading from left to right, top to bottom).  


                    The question is: What are the revenues for the 12 month period ending december 2023?  possible values: any number (positive or negative, including decimals)
 We also want to retrieve some meta information. In the following we will present the meta item ID and then the additional question to be answered, format: (META_ID): QUESTION.
(currency): What is the currency  possible values (select one from json array): ['USD', 'EUR', 'Other']
(unit): What is the unit?  possible values (select one from json array): ['none', 'thousands', 'millions', 'billions'] 

                    
                     


                    Your answer should be formatted as a JSON object. Under the key 'answers' can be one or more JSON object(s), with key value pairs for the main question and the meta items. For the main question use the key 'main_question', for the meta items use their ID as key. Under the key 'sources', you should also provide the numbers of the text fragments you used to answer the question. For example your answer could look like this: {""answers"": [{""main_question"": ""123"", ""currency"": ""USD"", ""unit"": ""none""}], ""sources"": [241, 423]}

 (col 0): (2) (col 1): Gross profit, calculated as net sales less cost of sales, and gross profit margin, calculated as gross profit divided by net sales, are non-GAAP financial measures as they exclude depreciation and amortization expense associated with the corresponding sales. About half of our orders are basic distribution with no processing services performed. For the remainder of our sales orders, we perform “first-stage” processing, which is generally not labor intensive as we are simply cutting the metal to size. Because of this, the amount of related labor and overhead, including depreciation and amortization, is not significant and is excluded from cost of sales. Therefore, our cost of sales is substantially comprised of the cost of the material we sell. We use gross profit and gross profit margin as shown above as measures of operating performance. Gross profit and gross profit margin are important operating and financial measures as their fluctuations can have a significant impact on our earnings. Gross profit and gross profit margin, as presented, are not necessarily comparable with similarly titled measures for other companies. (row end);

[222]: Table of Contents payment, discounts for price adjustments, product returns, allowances, and certain advertising and promotional costs, including consumer coupons, which are variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction of product sales revenue in the same period the related product sales are recorded. Such estimates are calculated using historical averages adjusted for any expected changes due to current business conditions and experience. Revenue for net product sales is recognized at a point in time when products are delivered to or picked up by the customer, as designated by customers’ purchase orders, as discussed in Note 1 of the Company’s Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ​ Provisions for bad debts are recorded as selling, marketing and administrative expenses. Write-offs of bad debts did not exceed 0.1% of net product sales in each of 2023, 2022 and 2021, and accordingly, have not been significant to the Company’s financial position or results of operations. ​ Intangible assets ​ The Company’s intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill and acquired trademarks. In accordance with accounting guidance, goodwill and other indefinite-lived assets, trademarks, are not amortized, but are instead subjected to annual testing for impairment unless certain triggering events or circumstances are noted. The Company performs its annual impairment review and assessment as of December 31. All trademarks have been assessed by management to have indefinite lives because they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. The Company reviews and assesses certain trademarks (non-amortizable intangible assets) for impairment by comparing the fair value of each trademark with its carrying value. Current accounting guidance provides entities an option of performing a qualitative assessment (a ""step-zero"" test) before performing a quantitative analysis. If the entity determines, on the basis of certain qualitative factors, that it is more-likely-than-not that the intangibles (goodwill and certain trademarks) are not impaired, the entity would not need to proceed to the two step impairment testing process (quantitative analysis) as prescribed in the guidance. During fourth quarter 2023, the Company performed a “step zero” test of its goodwill and certain trademarks, and concluded that there was no impairment based on this guidance. ​ The Company determines the fair value of certain trademarks using discounted cash flows and estimates of royalty rates. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, such trademarks are considered impaired and are reduced to fair value. The Company utilizes third-party professional valuation firms to assist in the determination of valuation of certain trademarks. Impairments have not generally been material to the Company’s historical operating results. Cash flow projections require the Company to make assumptions and estimates regarding the Company’s future plans, including sales projections and profit margins, market based discount rates, competitive factors, and economic conditions; and the Company’s actual results and conditions may differ over time. A change in the assumptions relating to the impairment analysis including but not limited to a reduction in projected cash flows, the use of a different discount rate to discount future cash flows or a different royalty rate applied to such trademarks, could cause impairment in the future. ​ Customer incentive programs, advertising and marketing ​ Advertising and marketing costs are recorded in the period to which such costs relate. The Company does not defer the recognition of any amounts on its consolidated balance sheet with respect to such costs. The expected cost of future payments to customers for incentives and other trade promotional programs is recorded at the time sale as a reduction of Net product sales. The liabilities associated with these programs are reviewed quarterly and adjusted if the expected utilization rate differs from management’s original estimates. Such adjustments have not historically been material to the Company’s operating results. ​ Valuation of long-lived assets ​ Long-lived assets, primarily property, plant and equipment, are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in business circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. The estimated cash flows produced by assets or asset groups, are compared to the asset carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. Such estimates involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance. As a result, actual cash flows could differ from management’s estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance, and economic and competitive conditions. Such impairments have not historically been material to the Company’s operating results. 21

[769]: The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. In addition, when we acquire businesses, we make judgments about how best to account for their revenue, assets and liabilities in our condensed consolidated financial statements. These judgments may be based on limited information, estimates and various assumptions, which we may revisit as we more fully integrate such businesses into our company. Critical accounting policies and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to: revenue recognition; write-down of supplies; the useful lives of property, plant and equipment; the recoverability of long-lived assets; the incremental borrowing rate for leases; the estimation of the fair value of intangible assets and contingent consideration; variable interest entity assessment; impairment of equity investment, at cost; stock options; income tax uncertainties, including a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets; reserve on accounts receivable and contingencies. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the price of our common stock.
[1134]: 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
[1135]: Basis of Presentation The Company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Reclassifications Certain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Such reclassifications have no effect on previously reported results of operations, accumulated deficit, subtotals of operating, investing or financing cash flows or consolidated balance sheet totals; however, for the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company reclassified $ 3.3 million of impairment of long-lived assets from the general and administrative expense caption in the consolidated statements of operations. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates include: revenue recognition; the useful lives of property, plant and equipment; the recoverability of long-lived assets; the incremental borrowing rates for leases; accounting for acquisitions; the estimation of the fair value of intangible assets and contingent consideration; stock based compensation; income tax uncertainties, including a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets; credit related losses on investments; and allowance for credit losses and contingencies. The Company bases these estimates on historical and anticipated results, trends, and various other assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. These estimates
[903]: Product Revenue
[904]: Our products consist of the Prosigna breast cancer assay, the nCounter Analysis System, related diagnostic kits, and services. We recognize product revenue when control of the promised goods is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those products. This process involves identifying the contract with a customer, determining the performance obligations in the contract, determining the contract price, allocating the contract price to the distinct performance obligations in the contract, and recognizing revenue when the performance obligations have been satisfied. A performance obligation is considered distinct from other obligations in a contract when it provides a benefit to the customer, either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer, and is separately identified in the contract. Performance obligations are considered satisfied once we have transferred control of a product to the customer, meaning the customer has the ability to use and obtain the benefit of the product. We recognize product revenue for satisfied performance obligations only when there are no uncertainties regarding payment terms or transfer of control. Shipping and handling costs incurred for product shipments are charged to our customers and included in product revenue. Revenue is presented net of the taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities.
[923]: Cost of Product Revenue
[924]: Our cost of product revenue consists primarily of costs of purchasing instruments and diagnostic kits from third-party contract manufacturers, installation, warranty, service and packaging and delivery costs. In addition, cost of product revenue includes royalty costs for licensed technologies included in our products and labor expenses. As our Prosigna test kits are sold in various configurations with different number of tests, our product cost per test will vary based on the specific kit configuration purchased by customers.
[925]: Cost of Biopharmaceutical and Other Revenue
[926]: Our cost of biopharmaceutical and other revenue are the costs of performing activities under arrangements that require us to perform research and development, commercialization, contract manufacturing and development, and previously included contract testing services on behalf of a customer. This cost is mainly composed of compensation expense, manufacturing and laboratory supplies and pass-through costs.

[750]: Gross Profit and Gross Margin
[751]: Gross profit consists of our net revenues less cost of goods sold. Gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of our net revenues. Our cost of goods sold primarily consists of the cost of raw materials including ingredients and packaging, co-manufacturing fees, direct and indirect labor and certain supply costs, inbound and internal shipping and handling costs incurred in manufacturing our products, warehouse storage fees, plant and equipment overhead, depreciation and amortization expense, provision for excess and obsolete inventory, and accelerated depreciation on write-offs and disposals of certain fixed assets. Under certain circumstances, our cost of goods sold may also include underutilization and/or termination fees associated with our co-manufacturing agreements. Gross profit and gross margin in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the prior-year periods were positively impacted by lower manufacturing costs including lower depreciation expense resulting from a change in the estimated useful lives of certain of our large manufacturing equipment. See Note 6 , Property, Plant and Equipment, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.
[1059]: Presentation of Net Revenues by Channel
[1060]: The following table presents the Company’s net revenues by channel:
[1062]: One distributor accounted for approximately 12 % of the Company’s gross revenues in each of 2023 and 2022; two distributors accounted for approximately 12 % and 11 % of the Company’s gross revenues in 2021. No other distributor or customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s gross revenues in 2023, 2022 or 2021.

[1065]: Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
[1067]: Earnings (Loss) Per Share Earnings (loss) per share (“EPS”) represents net income available to common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS represents net income available to common stockholders divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, inclusive of the dilutive impact of potential common shares outstanding during the period. Such potential common shares include options, unvested restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and contracts classified as assets or liabilities that are required or assumed to be share-settled under the two-class method. The Company calculates basic and diluted EPS available to common stockholders in conformity with the two-class method required for companies with participating securities. Pursuant to ASU 2020-06, the Company applies the more dilutive of the if-converted method and the two-class method to its Notes. Computation of EPS for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 also excludes adjustments under the two-class method relating to a liability classified, share-settled obligation to an executive officer to deliver a variable number of shares based on a fixed monetary amount because the shares to be delivered are not participating securities as they do not have voting rights and are not entitled to participate in dividends until they are issued. In periods when the Company records net loss, all potential common shares are excluded in the computation of EPS because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. See Note 12 . Prepaid Expenses Prepaid expenses primarily include prepaid insurance and other prepaid vendor costs, which are expensed in the period to which they relate. Prepaid expenses are included under the caption “Prepaid assets and other assets” in consolidated balance sheets and were $ 8.3 million, and $ 14.5 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Investment in Joint Venture The Company uses the equity method of accounting to record transactions associated with its joint venture when the Company shares in joint control of the investee. Investment in joint venture is not consolidated but is recorded in “Investment in unconsolidated joint venture” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The Company recognizes its portion of the investee’s results in “Equity in losses of unconsolidated joint venture” in its consolidated statement of operations. The Company eliminates its proportionate interest in any intra-entity profits or losses in the inventory of the investee at the end of the reporting period and recognizes its portion of the profit and losses when realized by the investee. Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Expenses SG&A expenses are primarily comprised of selling, marketing expenses and administrative expenses, including personnel and related expenses, share-based compensation, outbound shipping and handling costs, non-manufacturing lease expense, depreciation and amortization expense on non-manufacturing and non-research and development assets, charges related to asset write-offs including loss on sale and write-down of fixed assets, consulting fees and other non-production operating expenses. Marketing and selling expenses include advertising costs, share-based compensation awards to brand ambassadors, costs associated with consumer promotions, product donations, product samples and sales aids incurred to acquire new customers, retain existing customers and build brand awareness. Administrative expenses include expenses related to management, accounting, legal, IT and other office functions. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $ 17.2 million, $ 20.6 million and $ 12.1 million, respectively. Non-advertising related components of the Company’s total marketing expenditures primarily include costs associated with consumer promotions, product sampling and sales aids, which are also included in SG&A. Shipping and Handling Costs
[800]: Gross profit and gross margin in 2023 as compared to 2022 were negatively impacted by lower net revenues per pound, higher inventory provision per pound and higher manufacturing costs including depreciation, partially offset by lower logistics costs and lower materials costs per pound. The increase in inventory provision included $38.0 million in non-cash charges resulting from our Global Operations Review. In addition, gross profit and gross margin in 2023 included a $4.4 million in contract termination costs associated with a certain co-manufacturing agreement and $6.1 million in additional provision for inventory associated with a large QSR customer. In 2023, gross profit and gross margin benefited by $19.0 million and 23%, respectively, as a result of a change in the estimated useful lives of certain of our large manufacturing equipment, as compared to those same measures calculated using our previous estimated useful lives. See Note 6 , Property, Plant and Equipment , to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.

[822]: Table element - Text before table: Provision for taxes was $526 million and $573 million for the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, respectively, a decrease in income tax expense of $47 million. The decrease is primarily due to changes in income before taxes and tax reserve releases due to statute of limitation expirations. The decrease is offset by a reduction in our capacity to utilize foreign tax credits against U.S. foreign source income due to the increase in annual interest expense. As a result, we recorded a valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset related to future foreign tax credit benefits.

[1459]: Segment profit is based on Operating income, excluding depreciation and amortization, non-recurring Separation-related costs, restructuring expenses and operating model optimization initiatives, the impact of the conversion of stock-based awards, issuance of Founder Shares, Other operating (income) expense, net, and unallocated general corporate administrative expenses (referred to herein as “Segment adjusted operating income”), as management excludes these items in assessing segment financial performance. General corporate/unallocated expenses, which include expenses related to treasury, legal operations and certain other expenses, along with gains and losses related to the overall management of the Company, are not allocated to the segments. In assessing segment performance and managing operations, management does not review segment assets.
[1460]: The Company operates the business through the following three reportable business segments:
[1462]: The Company’s product categories as a percentage of Net sales for the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023, January 1, 2023, and January 2, 2022 were as follows:
[828]: Provision For Taxes
[829]: Provision for taxes was $573 million and $847 million for the fiscal twelve months ended January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, respectively, a decrease in income tax expense of $274 million. The $274 million decrease in income tax expense was primarily due to a lower effective tax rate in the fiscal twelve months ended January 1, 2023 resulting from the ability to claim certain deductions and additional foreign tax credits that were limited in the fiscal twelve months ended January 2, 2022 as a result of the talc litigation settlement.
[830]: Segment Results
[831]: Segment profit is based on Operating income, excluding depreciation and amortization, non-recurring Separation-related costs, restructuring expenses and operating model optimization initiatives, the impact of the conversion of stock-based awards, issuance of Founder Shares, Other operating (income) expense, net, and unallocated general corporate administrative expenses (referred to herein as “Segment adjusted operating income”), as management excludes these items in assessing segment financial performance. General corporate/unallocated expenses, which include expenses related to treasury, legal operations and certain other expenses, along with gains and losses related to the overall management of our company, are not allocated to the segments. In assessing segment performance and managing operations, management does not review segment assets.

[1534]: The financial statements required by this item are listed in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”.
[1535]: (a) (2) Financial Statement Schedules
[1536]: All financial statement schedules have been omitted because they are not applicable, not required or the information required is shown in the financial statements or the notes thereto.
[840]: Organic Growth
[841]: We assess our Net sales performance by measuring Organic growth, a non-GAAP financial measure, which measures the period-over-period change in Net sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of
[842]: acquisitions and divestitures. Management believes Organic growth provides investors with additional, supplemental information that they may find useful in assessing our results of operations by excluding the impact of certain items that we believe do not directly reflect our underlying operations.
[843]: The following tables present a reconciliation of the change in U.S. GAAP Net sales to Organic growth for the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023 compared to the fiscal twelve months ended January 1, 2023:
[846]: (1) Acquisitions and divestitures did not materially impact the reported Net sales change.
[847]: (2) Also referred to as value realization.
[848]: A detailed discussion of the period-over-period changes in Segment net sales and Segment adjusted operating income for the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and the fiscal twelve months ended January 1, 2023 is presented below. A detailed discussion of the period-over-period changes in Segment net sales and Segment adjusted operating income for the fiscal twelve months ended January 1, 2023 and the fiscal twelve months ended January 2, 2022 can be found under the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our IPO Prospectus.
[1003]: Revenue Recognition – U.S. Net Sales
[1004]: As described in Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s total net sales were $15.4 billion for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, of which, $6.8 billion is related to U.S. net sales. Management recognizes the revenue from these sales at a single point in time when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer depending on the terms of the contract. Trade promotions, comprised of coupons, product listing allowances, cooperative advertising arrangements, volume-based incentive programs, as well as discounts to customers, rebates, sales incentives, and product returns, are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales in the same period as the related sale.
[1005]: 78
[1006]: The principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to U.S. net sales revenue recognition is a critical audit matter is a high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures related to the Company’s U.S. net sales revenue recognition.
[1464]: 132
[1465]: Segment Net Sales and Segment Adjusted Operating Income
[1466]: Segment net sales and Segment adjusted operating income for the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023, January 1, 2023, and January 2, 2022 were as follows:
[1469]: (1) In the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company adjusted the allocation for certain intangible asset amortization costs within Cost of     Sales to align with segment financial results as measured by the Company, including the CODM. Accordingly, the Company has updated its segment disclosures to reflect the updated presentation in all prior periods. Total segment adjusted operating income did not change as a result of this update.
[1470]: (2) Exclusive of the restructuring expenses and operating model optimization initiatives included in Other operating expense (income), net in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.
[1471]: (3) Segment adjusted operating income excludes the impact of the conversion of stock-based awards (see Note 11, Stock-Based Compensation). This adjustment primarily represents the add-back of the net impact of the gain on reversal of previously recognized stock-based compensation expense of $ 148 million, offset by stock-based compensation expense recognized in the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023 relating to employee services provided prior to the Separation of $ 203 million.
[1492]: 21. Selected Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)
[1493]: As described in Note 1, “Description of the Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” effective in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company changed its accounting principle for GILTI from the deferred approach to the period cost approach, which resulted in adjustments to the Provisions for taxes and Income before taxes line items in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other comprehensive income (loss) line in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Selected unaudited quarterly financial data has been adjusted for the change in accounting principle for the fiscal years 2023 and 2022 and is summarized below:
[1496]: Item 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
[1497]: Not applicable.
[1498]: 135
[1499]: Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
[1500]: Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
[1501]: At the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, management of the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Thibaut Mongon, and Chief Financial Officer, Paul Ruh, reviewed and participated in this evaluation of Kenvue’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, Messrs. Mongon and Ruh concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

These supply chain actions have included expanding its use of strategic collaborations, and bolstering its initiatives to reduce complexity, improving cost-competitiveness, enhancing capabilities, and optimizing its network. The restructuring charges associated with the program, and directly attributed to the Company, were primarily related to contractors/outside services, asset write-downs, and accelerated depreciation.

[822]: Table element - Text before table: Provision for taxes was $526 million and $573 million for the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, respectively, a decrease in income tax expense of $47 million. The decrease is primarily due to changes in income before taxes and tax reserve releases due to statute of limitation expirations. The decrease is offset by a reduction in our capacity to utilize foreign tax credits against U.S. foreign source income due to the increase in annual interest expense. As a result, we recorded a valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset related to future foreign tax credit benefits.

[822]: Table element - Text before table: Provision for taxes was $526 million and $573 million for the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, respectively, a decrease in income tax expense of $47 million. The decrease is primarily due to changes in income before taxes and tax reserve releases due to statute of limitation expirations. The decrease is offset by a reduction in our capacity to utilize foreign tax credits against U.S. foreign source income due to the increase in annual interest expense. As a result, we recorded a valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset related to future foreign tax credit benefits.

[822]: Table element - Text before table: Provision for taxes was $526 million and $573 million for the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, respectively, a decrease in income tax expense of $47 million. The decrease is primarily due to changes in income before taxes and tax reserve releases due to statute of limitation expirations. The decrease is offset by a reduction in our capacity to utilize foreign tax credits against U.S. foreign source income due to the increase in annual interest expense. As a result, we recorded a valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset related to future foreign tax credit benefits.

[569]: Revenue
[570]: Our revenue as historically been derived from our collaboration agreements, under which we may receive product sales revenue, royalties, and license fees, as well as development and sales milestones and other contingent payments. We recognize revenue when we transfer promised goods or services to our collaboration partners.
[571]: • Product sales and Cost of goods sold: Product sales include predominantly fixed price manufacturing and supply agreements with our collaboration partners and are the result of firm purchase orders from those partners. Accordingly, the revenue recognized in a given period is based solely on the demand and requirements of our collaboration partners and is not ratable throughout the year. We expect product sales to increase for 2024 as compared to 2023 due to increased demand from our partners with a corresponding increase in cost of goods sold.

[132]: Table of Contents For the Years Ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 We recognized a net loss of $62.6 million, $105.0 million and a net income of $179.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The net loss of $62.6 million and $105.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 included a non-cash gain of $1.5 million and a non-cash loss of $25.8 million from change in fair value derivative liabilities and convertible notes, respectively. The net income of $179.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 included a non-cash gain of $239.3 million from change in fair value derivative liabilities. Net cash used in operations was $53.6 million, $52.8 million and $38.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Research and development expense For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, research and development expense was $27.7 million, $35.5 million and $20.3 million, respectively. The increase in R&D in 2023 and 2022 as compared to 2021 was mainly reflected extensive one-time activities, which were started in mid of 2022 and fully completed as of December 31, 2023. The R&D expenses in 2023 and 2022 primarily reflected extensive one-time activities (i) to accomplish a number of pre-requisites that are required before making an application for regulatory of DCVax-L, (ii) to prepare the application package and (iii) to prepare other materials, such as the Trial Master File, to be inspection-ready in addition to the application package. The pre-requisites and preparations included developing, submitting and obtaining regulatory approval for a Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP), preparing and qualifying for manufacturing licenses required for the Sawston facility, completing the technology transfer from the London facility (where the Company had done all its manufacturing before 2022) to the Sawston facility to enable GMP manufacturing to begin in February 2022 at Sawston (while also continuing in the London facility), and six workstreams related to product matters involving Comparability, Stability, Potency, Product Profile, Mechanism of Action and Fill/Finish which are needed for the application package to seek regulatory approval of DCVax-L. The 2023 and 2022 R&D expenses we incurred for these activities included payments to numerous teams of specialized external consultants and the CRO, as well as to Advent BioServices. The majority of the payments to Advent were for one-time expenses for ten key one-time milestones for pre-requisites and preparations for the MAA application for product approval. These included three milestones for obtaining the three licenses required for the Sawston facility, six milestones for the six product workstreams, and 1 milestone related to preparing key portions of an application for regulatory approval of the DCVax-L product. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we completed the last three one-time milestones (obtaining a commercial manufacturing license from the MHRA, completion of drafting and submission of the application to MHRA for product approval), and recognized additional $1.5 million in research and development expense. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we paid $3.0 million for the cash component of seven milestones, and accrued $4.7 million for the cash component of future milestones. We issued 7.5 million shares at fair value of $5.9 million for the stock component of eight milestones, and we accrued $3.6 million for the stock component of future milestones. General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expenses were $29.7 million, $33.4 million and $33.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease of $3.6 million in 2023 compared to 2022 was mainly related to a decrease of $1.6 million in consulting, legal and professional fees, a decrease of $0.7 million in compensation expenses and a $0.9 million reduction in our director and officer insurance expenses. Expenses incurred in 2022 and 2021 were consistent with rounding, but there was a slight decrease of approximate $46,000 which was mainly related to a decrease of $7.0 million stock-based compensation that represented the vesting of a portion of previously granted equity-based awards, and that was recognized in general and administrative expense, and offset by an increase of approximately $1.8 million related to legal and professional expenses, an increase of $1.5 million in insurance premiums, an increase of $1.6 million related 29

[291]: Table of Contents NORTHWEST BIOTHERAPEUTICS, INC. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not consolidate any VIE’s as the Company has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary. Use of Estimates In preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Due to inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be affected by changes in these estimates. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments, including valuing equity securities in share-based payment arrangements, estimating the fair value of financial instruments recorded as derivative liabilities, useful lives of depreciable assets and whether impairment charges may apply. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist of cash accounts in a financial institution, which at times may exceed the Federal depository insurance coverage (“FDIC”) of $ 250,000 . As of December 31, 2023, of the total $ 2.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, $ 36,000 was held by foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2022, of the total $ 7.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, $ 0.4 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. The Company had not experienced losses on these accounts and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such accounts. Property, Plant and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided for using straight-line methods, in amounts sufficient to charge the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated service lives. Repairs and maintenance costs are charged to operations as incurred. Costs for capital assets not yet placed into service are capitalized as construction in progress on the consolidated balance sheets and will be depreciated once placed into service. In October 2021, approval was received from the UK Human Tissue Authority (“HTA”) of a license for collection and processing of human cells and tissues for medical purposes at the Company’s Sawston, UK facility. In December 2021, approval was received from the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) of a license for manufacture at the Sawston facility of GMP (clinical grade) cell therapy products for compassionate use and trials. All costs associated with the facility buildout (Phase 1A) were reclassified from construction in progress to leasehold improvements, and the costs began to be amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset and/or leasehold lease. The Company incurred additional construction works related to Phase 1B build out during the year ended December 31, 2022, which was completed and placed in use in 2023. F-11
[294]: Table of Contents NORTHWEST BIOTHERAPEUTICS, INC. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions The Company has operations in the United Kingdom and Netherlands in addition to the U.S. The Company translated its assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars using end of period exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars using weighted average rates. Foreign currency translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders’ equity deficit. The Company converts receivables and payables denominated in other than the Company’s functional currency at the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date. The resulting transaction exchange gains or losses related to intercompany receivable and payables, are included in other income and expense. Comprehensive Loss The Company reports comprehensive loss and its components in its consolidated financial statements. Comprehensive loss consists of net loss and foreign currency translation adjustments, affecting stockholders’ equity deficit that, under U.S, GAAP, is excluded from net loss. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the terms stipulated under the applicable service contract. In various situations, the Company receives certain credits against invoices for manufacturing of patient treatments by its contract manufacturer. These payments are assessed and recognized in accordance with ASC 606 in the period when the performance obligation had been met. Accrued Outsourcing Costs Substantial portions of our preclinical studies and clinical trials are performed by third-party laboratories, medical centers, contract research organizations and other vendors (collectively “CROs”). These CROs generally bill monthly or quarterly for services performed, or bill based upon milestones achieved. For clinical studies, expenses are accrued when services are performed. The Company monitors patient enrollment, the progress of clinical studies and related activities through internal reviews of data that is tracked by the CROs under contractual arrangements, correspondence with the CROs and visits to clinical sites. Research and Development Costs Research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred and consist primarily of clinical trial related costs (including costs for collection, validation and analysis of trial results), related party manufacturing costs, consulting costs, contract research and development costs, clinical site costs and compensation costs. Income Taxes The Company evaluates its tax positions and estimates its current tax exposure along with assessing temporary differences that result from different book to tax treatment of items not currently deductible for tax purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets, which are estimated based upon the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse. In general, deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized. Accordingly, realization of the Company’s deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income against which these deductions, losses and credits can be utilized. F-14

[407]: 8. Net Earnings (Loss) per Share Applicable to Common Stockholders
[408]: Basic earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net earnings (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share is computed similar to basic earnings (loss) per common share except that it reflects the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities or other obligations to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. Diluted weighted average common shares include common stock potentially issuable under the Company’s convertible notes, warrants and vested and unvested stock options.

[132]: Table of Contents For the Years Ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 We recognized a net loss of $62.6 million, $105.0 million and a net income of $179.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The net loss of $62.6 million and $105.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 included a non-cash gain of $1.5 million and a non-cash loss of $25.8 million from change in fair value derivative liabilities and convertible notes, respectively. The net income of $179.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 included a non-cash gain of $239.3 million from change in fair value derivative liabilities. Net cash used in operations was $53.6 million, $52.8 million and $38.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Research and development expense For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, research and development expense was $27.7 million, $35.5 million and $20.3 million, respectively. The increase in R&D in 2023 and 2022 as compared to 2021 was mainly reflected extensive one-time activities, which were started in mid of 2022 and fully completed as of December 31, 2023. The R&D expenses in 2023 and 2022 primarily reflected extensive one-time activities (i) to accomplish a number of pre-requisites that are required before making an application for regulatory of DCVax-L, (ii) to prepare the application package and (iii) to prepare other materials, such as the Trial Master File, to be inspection-ready in addition to the application package. The pre-requisites and preparations included developing, submitting and obtaining regulatory approval for a Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP), preparing and qualifying for manufacturing licenses required for the Sawston facility, completing the technology transfer from the London facility (where the Company had done all its manufacturing before 2022) to the Sawston facility to enable GMP manufacturing to begin in February 2022 at Sawston (while also continuing in the London facility), and six workstreams related to product matters involving Comparability, Stability, Potency, Product Profile, Mechanism of Action and Fill/Finish which are needed for the application package to seek regulatory approval of DCVax-L. The 2023 and 2022 R&D expenses we incurred for these activities included payments to numerous teams of specialized external consultants and the CRO, as well as to Advent BioServices. The majority of the payments to Advent were for one-time expenses for ten key one-time milestones for pre-requisites and preparations for the MAA application for product approval. These included three milestones for obtaining the three licenses required for the Sawston facility, six milestones for the six product workstreams, and 1 milestone related to preparing key portions of an application for regulatory approval of the DCVax-L product. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we completed the last three one-time milestones (obtaining a commercial manufacturing license from the MHRA, completion of drafting and submission of the application to MHRA for product approval), and recognized additional $1.5 million in research and development expense. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we paid $3.0 million for the cash component of seven milestones, and accrued $4.7 million for the cash component of future milestones. We issued 7.5 million shares at fair value of $5.9 million for the stock component of eight milestones, and we accrued $3.6 million for the stock component of future milestones. General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expenses were $29.7 million, $33.4 million and $33.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease of $3.6 million in 2023 compared to 2022 was mainly related to a decrease of $1.6 million in consulting, legal and professional fees, a decrease of $0.7 million in compensation expenses and a $0.9 million reduction in our director and officer insurance expenses. Expenses incurred in 2022 and 2021 were consistent with rounding, but there was a slight decrease of approximate $46,000 which was mainly related to a decrease of $7.0 million stock-based compensation that represented the vesting of a portion of previously granted equity-based awards, and that was recognized in general and administrative expense, and offset by an increase of approximately $1.8 million related to legal and professional expenses, an increase of $1.5 million in insurance premiums, an increase of $1.6 million related 29

[132]: Table of Contents For the Years Ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 We recognized a net loss of $62.6 million, $105.0 million and a net income of $179.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The net loss of $62.6 million and $105.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 included a non-cash gain of $1.5 million and a non-cash loss of $25.8 million from change in fair value derivative liabilities and convertible notes, respectively. The net income of $179.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 included a non-cash gain of $239.3 million from change in fair value derivative liabilities. Net cash used in operations was $53.6 million, $52.8 million and $38.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Research and development expense For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, research and development expense was $27.7 million, $35.5 million and $20.3 million, respectively. The increase in R&D in 2023 and 2022 as compared to 2021 was mainly reflected extensive one-time activities, which were started in mid of 2022 and fully completed as of December 31, 2023. The R&D expenses in 2023 and 2022 primarily reflected extensive one-time activities (i) to accomplish a number of pre-requisites that are required before making an application for regulatory of DCVax-L, (ii) to prepare the application package and (iii) to prepare other materials, such as the Trial Master File, to be inspection-ready in addition to the application package. The pre-requisites and preparations included developing, submitting and obtaining regulatory approval for a Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP), preparing and qualifying for manufacturing licenses required for the Sawston facility, completing the technology transfer from the London facility (where the Company had done all its manufacturing before 2022) to the Sawston facility to enable GMP manufacturing to begin in February 2022 at Sawston (while also continuing in the London facility), and six workstreams related to product matters involving Comparability, Stability, Potency, Product Profile, Mechanism of Action and Fill/Finish which are needed for the application package to seek regulatory approval of DCVax-L. The 2023 and 2022 R&D expenses we incurred for these activities included payments to numerous teams of specialized external consultants and the CRO, as well as to Advent BioServices. The majority of the payments to Advent were for one-time expenses for ten key one-time milestones for pre-requisites and preparations for the MAA application for product approval. These included three milestones for obtaining the three licenses required for the Sawston facility, six milestones for the six product workstreams, and 1 milestone related to preparing key portions of an application for regulatory approval of the DCVax-L product. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we completed the last three one-time milestones (obtaining a commercial manufacturing license from the MHRA, completion of drafting and submission of the application to MHRA for product approval), and recognized additional $1.5 million in research and development expense. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we paid $3.0 million for the cash component of seven milestones, and accrued $4.7 million for the cash component of future milestones. We issued 7.5 million shares at fair value of $5.9 million for the stock component of eight milestones, and we accrued $3.6 million for the stock component of future milestones. General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expenses were $29.7 million, $33.4 million and $33.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease of $3.6 million in 2023 compared to 2022 was mainly related to a decrease of $1.6 million in consulting, legal and professional fees, a decrease of $0.7 million in compensation expenses and a $0.9 million reduction in our director and officer insurance expenses. Expenses incurred in 2022 and 2021 were consistent with rounding, but there was a slight decrease of approximate $46,000 which was mainly related to a decrease of $7.0 million stock-based compensation that represented the vesting of a portion of previously granted equity-based awards, and that was recognized in general and administrative expense, and offset by an increase of approximately $1.8 million related to legal and professional expenses, an increase of $1.5 million in insurance premiums, an increase of $1.6 million related 29

The net loss of $62.6 million and $105.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 included a non-cash gain of $1.5 million and a non-cash loss of $25.8 million from change in fair value derivative liabilities and convertible notes, respectively.

[132]: Table of Contents For the Years Ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 We recognized a net loss of $62.6 million, $105.0 million and a net income of $179.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The net loss of $62.6 million and $105.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 included a non-cash gain of $1.5 million and a non-cash loss of $25.8 million from change in fair value derivative liabilities and convertible notes, respectively. The net income of $179.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 included a non-cash gain of $239.3 million from change in fair value derivative liabilities. Net cash used in operations was $53.6 million, $52.8 million and $38.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Research and development expense For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, research and development expense was $27.7 million, $35.5 million and $20.3 million, respectively. The increase in R&D in 2023 and 2022 as compared to 2021 was mainly reflected extensive one-time activities, which were started in mid of 2022 and fully completed as of December 31, 2023. The R&D expenses in 2023 and 2022 primarily reflected extensive one-time activities (i) to accomplish a number of pre-requisites that are required before making an application for regulatory of DCVax-L, (ii) to prepare the application package and (iii) to prepare other materials, such as the Trial Master File, to be inspection-ready in addition to the application package. The pre-requisites and preparations included developing, submitting and obtaining regulatory approval for a Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP), preparing and qualifying for manufacturing licenses required for the Sawston facility, completing the technology transfer from the London facility (where the Company had done all its manufacturing before 2022) to the Sawston facility to enable GMP manufacturing to begin in February 2022 at Sawston (while also continuing in the London facility), and six workstreams related to product matters involving Comparability, Stability, Potency, Product Profile, Mechanism of Action and Fill/Finish which are needed for the application package to seek regulatory approval of DCVax-L. The 2023 and 2022 R&D expenses we incurred for these activities included payments to numerous teams of specialized external consultants and the CRO, as well as to Advent BioServices. The majority of the payments to Advent were for one-time expenses for ten key one-time milestones for pre-requisites and preparations for the MAA application for product approval. These included three milestones for obtaining the three licenses required for the Sawston facility, six milestones for the six product workstreams, and 1 milestone related to preparing key portions of an application for regulatory approval of the DCVax-L product. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we completed the last three one-time milestones (obtaining a commercial manufacturing license from the MHRA, completion of drafting and submission of the application to MHRA for product approval), and recognized additional $1.5 million in research and development expense. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we paid $3.0 million for the cash component of seven milestones, and accrued $4.7 million for the cash component of future milestones. We issued 7.5 million shares at fair value of $5.9 million for the stock component of eight milestones, and we accrued $3.6 million for the stock component of future milestones. General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expenses were $29.7 million, $33.4 million and $33.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease of $3.6 million in 2023 compared to 2022 was mainly related to a decrease of $1.6 million in consulting, legal and professional fees, a decrease of $0.7 million in compensation expenses and a $0.9 million reduction in our director and officer insurance expenses. Expenses incurred in 2022 and 2021 were consistent with rounding, but there was a slight decrease of approximate $46,000 which was mainly related to a decrease of $7.0 million stock-based compensation that represented the vesting of a portion of previously granted equity-based awards, and that was recognized in general and administrative expense, and offset by an increase of approximately $1.8 million related to legal and professional expenses, an increase of $1.5 million in insurance premiums, an increase of $1.6 million related 29

[1605]: The cost associated with pre-launch activities performed by the Company is recorded within total operating expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.  In the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 , the Company recognized $ 1,446 , $ 6,102 , and $ 2,168 in research and development expenses and $ 4,242 , $ 8,953 , and $ 3,383 in general and administrative expenses, respectively, associated with pre-launch activities performed. The pre-launch activities were completed prior to the first commercial sale of VOWST, which occurred in June 2023.
[1606]: Under the 2021 License Agreement with Nestlé, beginning with the first commercial sale of VOWST, which occurred in June 2023, net sales of VOWST are recorded by Nestlé and include gross sales net of discounts, rebates, allowances, and other applicable deductions. These amounts include the use of estimates and judgments, which could be adjusted based on actual results in the future. The Company records its share of the profits or losses from the sales of VOWST, including commercial and medical affairs expenses incurred by the Company, on a net basis, as collaboration (profit) loss sharing - related party. This treatment is in accordance with the Company’s revenue recognition and collaboration policy, given that Nestlé and the Company are both active participants in commercialization activities and are exposed to significant risks and rewards that are dependent on the commercial success of the activities in the 2021 License Agreement. Nestlé provides the Company with reporting related to net sales of VOWST in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles in order to calculate and record collaboration profit or loss.
[1408]: Grant Revenue The Company generates revenue from government contracts that reimburse the Company for certain allowable costs for funded projects. For contracts with government agencies, when the Company has concluded that it is the principal in conducting the research and development expenses, and where the funding arrangement is considered central to the Company’s ongoing operations, the Company classifies the recognized funding received as revenue.
[1409]: The Company has concluded to recognize funding received as revenue, rather than as a reduction of research and development expenses, because the Company is the principal in conducting the research and development activities and these contracts are central to its ongoing operations. Revenue is recognized as the qualifying expenses related to the contracts are incurred. Revenue recognized upon incurring qualifying expenses in advance of receipt of funding is recorded in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as accounts receivable. The related costs incurred by the Company are included in research and development expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
[1382]: 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
[1383]: Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. In these consolidated financial statements, the Company uses estimates and assumptions related to revenue recognition and the accrual of research and development expenses. Estimates are periodically reviewed in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. Actual results could differ from the Company’s estimates.
[1384]: Cash Equivalents The Company considers all short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less at acquisition date to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents, which consist of money market accounts, commercial paper and corporate bonds purchased with original maturities of less than 90 days from the date of purchase, are stated at fair value.
[1591]: Contract Balances from Contracts with Customers
[1592]: The following tables present changes in the Company’s contract liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:
[1595]: F- 33 SERES THERAPEUTICS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (amounts in thousands, except share and per share data)
[1596]: During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized the following revenues as a result of changes in the contract liability balances in the respective periods (in thousands):
[1598]: When consideration is received, or such consideration is unconditionally due, from a customer prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of a contract, a contract liability is recorded. Revenue is recognized from the contract liability over time using the cost-to-cost method.

[1600]: License Agreement with NHSc Rx License GmbH (Nestlé)
[1601]: Accounting Analysis
[1602]: The 2021 License Agreement represents a separate contract between Nestlé and the Company. The 2021 License Agreement is within the scope of Topic 808, and has elements that are within the scope of Topic 606 (see Note 14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ) and Topic 808.
[1031]: We expect that our general and administrative expenses will decrease starting in 2024 as the Restructuring Plan is expected to result in a reduction of personnel expenses due the workforce reduction and a reduction in external expenses including the elimination of non-essential expenses and consolidation of office space.  General and administrative expenses may increase as we undertake efforts from time to time to raise additional capital. We may also continue to incur increased expenses associated with being a public company, including increased costs of accounting, audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing rules and the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, director and officer insurance costs and investor and public relations costs.
[1032]: Collaboration (Profit) Loss Sharing - related party
[1033]: Under the 2021 License Agreement with Nestlé, VOWST net sales are recorded by Nestlé and include gross sales net of discounts, rebates, allowances, and other applicable deductions. These amounts include the use of estimates and judgments, which could be adjusted based on actual results in the future. We record our share of the profits or losses from the sales of VOWST, including our commercial and medical affairs expenses, on a net basis, as collaboration (profit) loss sharing - related party. This treatment is in accordance with our revenue recognition and collaboration policy, given that Nestlé and we are both active participants in commercialization activities and are exposed to significant risks and rewards that are dependent on the commercial success of the

[704]: Table element - Text before table: Income taxes decreased $45 million in 2023 compared with 2022 primarily due to the recognition of unamortized investment tax credits ($106 million), a remeasurement of state deferred tax assets and liabilities ($142 million), both related to the sale of the Clean Energy Businesses, a decrease in the valuation allowance on state and local income tax assets ($10 million) and an increase in amortization of investment tax credits ($3 million), offset in part by higher income before income tax expense due to the sale of the Clean Energy Businesses ($214 million) and a higher unitary state tax adjustment, net of federal benefit ($5 million).

[1127]: Estimates
[1129]: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
[1130]: Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss) by Component
[1131]: Changes to accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (OCI) for Con Edison and CECONY are as follows:
[1133]: (a)    Tax reclassified from accumulated OCI is reported in the income tax expense line item of the consolidated income statement.
[1134]: (b)    For the portion of unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit costs relating to the Utilities, costs are recorded into, and amortized out of, regulatory assets and liabilities instead of OCI. The net actuarial losses and prior service costs recognized during the period are included in the computation of total periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost. See Notes E and F.
[571]: (d)    Earnings per share on a diluted basis were $7.21 a share, $4.66 a share and $3.85 a share in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. See ""Earnings Per Common Share"" in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8.
[572]: The following tables present the estimated effect of major factors on earnings per share and net income for common stock for the years ended December 31, 2023 as compared with 2022, and 2022 as compared with 2021.
[579]: The Companies’ other operations and maintenance expenses for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:
[581]: (a) Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified within the Companies' other operations and maintenance expenses to conform with current period presentation.
[582]: (b) Includes Demand Side Management, System Benefit Charges and Public Service Law 18A assessments that are collected in revenues.
[583]: (c) On March 1, 2023, Con Edison completed the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses. See Note W and Note X to the financial statements in Item 8.
[1526]: Note P – Financial Information by Business Segment
[1527]: The business segments of each of the Companies, which are its operating segments, were determined based on management’s reporting and decision-making requirements in accordance with the accounting rules for segment reporting. Con Edison’s principal business segments are CECONY’s regulated utility activities, O&R’s regulated utility activities and Con Edison Transmission. CECONY’s principal business segments are its regulated electric, gas and steam utility activities. All revenues of these business segments are from customers located in the United States of America. Also, all assets of the business segments are located in the United States of America. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note A.
[1529]: Common services shared by the business segments are assigned directly or allocated based on various cost factors, depending on the nature of the service provided.
[1530]: The financial data for the business segments are as follows:

[704]: Table element - Text before table: Income taxes decreased $45 million in 2023 compared with 2022 primarily due to the recognition of unamortized investment tax credits ($106 million), a remeasurement of state deferred tax assets and liabilities ($142 million), both related to the sale of the Clean Energy Businesses, a decrease in the valuation allowance on state and local income tax assets ($10 million) and an increase in amortization of investment tax credits ($3 million), offset in part by higher income before income tax expense due to the sale of the Clean Energy Businesses ($214 million) and a higher unitary state tax adjustment, net of federal benefit ($5 million).

The fragments start with a number in square brackets and then the actual text. The lower the number of the fragment, the earlier the fragment appeared in the document (reading from left to right, top to bottom).  


                    The question is: What are the revenues for the 12 month period ending december 2023?  possible values: any number (positive or negative, including decimals)
 We also want to retrieve some meta information. In the following we will present the meta item ID and then the additional question to be answered, format: (META_ID): QUESTION.
(currency): What is the currency  possible values (select one from json array): ['USD', 'EUR', 'Other']
(unit): What is the unit?  possible values (select one from json array): ['none', 'thousands', 'millions', 'billions'] 

                    
                     


                    Your answer should be formatted as a JSON object. Under the key 'answers' can be one or more JSON object(s), with key value pairs for the main question and the meta items. For the main question use the key 'main_question', for the meta items use their ID as key. Under the key 'sources', you should also provide the numbers of the text fragments you used to answer the question. For example your answer could look like this: {""answers"": [{""main_question"": ""123"", ""currency"": ""USD"", ""unit"": ""none""}], ""sources"": [241, 423]}

[704]: Table element - Text before table: Income taxes decreased $45 million in 2023 compared with 2022 primarily due to the recognition of unamortized investment tax credits ($106 million), a remeasurement of state deferred tax assets and liabilities ($142 million), both related to the sale of the Clean Energy Businesses, a decrease in the valuation allowance on state and local income tax assets ($10 million) and an increase in amortization of investment tax credits ($3 million), offset in part by higher income before income tax expense due to the sale of the Clean Energy Businesses ($214 million) and a higher unitary state tax adjustment, net of federal benefit ($5 million).

[824]: Table element - Text before table: The Company generally leases its investment rental property to established tenants in the industrial, healthcare, restaurant, retail, and office property types. At December 31, 2023 , the Company had 796 real estate properties, 784 of which were leased under leases that have been classified as operating leases , nine that have been classified as direct financing leases, one that has been classified as a sales-type lease, and two that were vacant. Of the nine leases classified as direct financing leases , three include land portions which are accounted for as operating leases. The sales-type lease includes a land portion which is accounted for as an operating lease (see Revenue Recognition within Note 2). Most leases have initial terms of 10 to 20 years. The Company’s leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of fixed increases, increases in the CPI, or increases in the tenant’s sales volume. Generally, tenants are also required to pay all property taxes and assessments, substantially maintain the interior and exterior of the building, and maintain property and liability insurance coverage. The leases also typically provide for one or more multiple year renewal options, at the election of the tenant, and are subject to generally the same terms and conditions as the initial lease.

[711]: Basis of Accounting The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).
[712]: Use of Estimates The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates include, but are not limited to, the allocation of purchase price between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the fair value of long-lived assets and goodwill utilized in impairment assessments, the depreciable lives of rental property, the amortizable lives of intangible assets and liabilities, the probability of collecting outstanding and future lease payments, the fair value of the earnout liability, and the fair value of the Company’s interest rate swap agreements. Accordingly, actual results may differ from those estimates.

[652]: Opinion on the Financial Statements
[653]: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Broadstone Net Lease, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

[601]: Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
[602]: The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses as well as other disclosures in the financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and assumptions; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions, which in turn could have a material impact on our financial statements. A summary of our significant accounting policies and procedures are included in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”, contained in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

[824]: Table element - Text before table: The Company generally leases its investment rental property to established tenants in the industrial, healthcare, restaurant, retail, and office property types. At December 31, 2023 , the Company had 796 real estate properties, 784 of which were leased under leases that have been classified as operating leases , nine that have been classified as direct financing leases, one that has been classified as a sales-type lease, and two that were vacant. Of the nine leases classified as direct financing leases , three include land portions which are accounted for as operating leases. The sales-type lease includes a land portion which is accounted for as an operating lease (see Revenue Recognition within Note 2). Most leases have initial terms of 10 to 20 years. The Company’s leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of fixed increases, increases in the CPI, or increases in the tenant’s sales volume. Generally, tenants are also required to pay all property taxes and assessments, substantially maintain the interior and exterior of the building, and maintain property and liability insurance coverage. The leases also typically provide for one or more multiple year renewal options, at the election of the tenant, and are subject to generally the same terms and conditions as the initial lease.

[824]: Table element - Text before table: The Company generally leases its investment rental property to established tenants in the industrial, healthcare, restaurant, retail, and office property types. At December 31, 2023 , the Company had 796 real estate properties, 784 of which were leased under leases that have been classified as operating leases , nine that have been classified as direct financing leases, one that has been classified as a sales-type lease, and two that were vacant. Of the nine leases classified as direct financing leases , three include land portions which are accounted for as operating leases. The sales-type lease includes a land portion which is accounted for as an operating lease (see Revenue Recognition within Note 2). Most leases have initial terms of 10 to 20 years. The Company’s leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of fixed increases, increases in the CPI, or increases in the tenant’s sales volume. Generally, tenants are also required to pay all property taxes and assessments, substantially maintain the interior and exterior of the building, and maintain property and liability insurance coverage. The leases also typically provide for one or more multiple year renewal options, at the election of the tenant, and are subject to generally the same terms and conditions as the initial lease.

[1257]: 119
[1258]: Impact of Derivative Instruments on the Statement of Operations
[1259]: Unrealized gains and losses associated with changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not accounted for as cash flow hedges are reflected in current period results of operations.
[1260]: The following table summarizes the pre-tax effects of economic hedges that have not been designated as cash flow hedges or fair value hedges and trading activity on the Company's statement of operations. The effect of foreign exchange and commodity hedges is included within revenues and cost of operations. The effect of the interest rate contracts are included within interest expense. The effect of the Consumer Financing Program is included in other income, net.
[1263]: The reversals of acquired loss/(gain) positions were valued based upon the forward prices on the acquisition date. The roll-off amounts were offset by realized gains or losses at the settled prices and are reflected in revenue or cost of operations during the same period.
[576]: The Company intends to spend approximately $500 million reducing debt during 2024 to maintain its targeted credit metrics. The Company intends to fund the debt reduction from cash from operations.
[577]: 47
[578]: Consolidated Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022
[579]: The following table provides selected financial information for the Company:
[581]: (a) Includes realized gains and losses from financially settled transactions
[582]: (b) Includes trading gains and losses and ancillary revenues
[583]: (c) Includes amortization of SO 2 and NO x credits and excludes amortization of RGGI credits
[584]: Gross Margin
[585]: The Company calculates gross margin in order to evaluate operating performance as revenues less cost of fuel, purchased energy and other costs of sales, mark-to-market for economic hedging activities, contract and emission credit amortization and depreciation and amortization.
[586]: Economic Gross Margin
[587]: In addition to gross margin, the Company evaluates its operating performance using the measure of economic gross margin, which is not a GAAP measure and may not be comparable to other companies’ presentations or deemed more useful
[810]: Based on a sensitivity analysis using simplified assumptions, the impact of a $0.50 per MMBtu increase or decrease in natural gas prices across the term of the derivative contracts would result in a change of approximately $2.0 billion in the net value of derivatives as of December 31, 2023.
[811]: Critical Accounting Estimates
[812]: The Company's discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges, and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the accounting guidance has not changed.
[1147]: Table element - Text before table: The derivative liabilities are recorded in connection with the contractual future payment obligations with the financing providers under Vivint Smart Home’s Consumer Financing Program. The fair values of the derivatives liabilities as of the Acquisition Closing Date were valued using a discounted cash flow model, with inputs consisting of available market data, such as market yield discount rates, as well as unobservable internally derived assumptions, such as collateral prepayment rates, collateral default rates and credit loss rates. These derivatives are classified as Level 3 and changes to the fair value are recorded through other income, net in the consolidated statement of operations. For additional discussion, see Note 6, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.

[1004]: Critical Audit Matters
[1005]: The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
[1006]: Evaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence over revenues
[1007]: As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had $ 28,823 million of revenues. Revenue is derived from various revenue streams in different geographic markets and the Company’s processes and related information technology (IT) systems used to record revenue differ for each of these revenue streams.

[625]: Table element - Text before table: For the year ended December 31, 2023, the $144 million gain in revenues from economic hedge positions was driven by an increase in the value of open positions as a result of decreases in power prices. The $3.0 billion loss in operating costs and expenses from economic hedge positions was driven primarily by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains on contracts that settled during the period, as well as a decrease in the value of East and West/Other open positions as a result of decreases in natural gas and power prices. This was partially offset by an increase in the value of Texas open positions as a result of increases in ERCOT power prices.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, the $83 million loss in revenues from economic hedge positions was driven by a decrease in the value of open positions as a result of increases in power prices across all segments, partially offset by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses on contracts that settled during the period. The $1.3 billion gain in operating costs and expenses from economic hedge positions was driven primarily by an increase in the value of open positions as a result of increases in natural gas and power prices across all segments partially offset by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains on contracts that settled during the period.

[753]: Table element - Text before table: The increase in continuing assets in 2023 was primarily driven by higher cash from net income, the retention of an ownership interest in GEHC, partially offset by cash paid for share redemptions and repurchases and depreciation and amortization on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. Property, plant and equipment – net associated with operations based in the United States and outside the United States was approximately 4 % and 3 % and 3 % and 4 % of total continuing assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

[77]: CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
[78]: SUMMARY OF 2023 RESULTS. Total revenues were $68.0 billion, up $9.9 billion for the year, driven by increases at all segments and Corporate.
[79]: Continuing earnings (loss) per share was $7.98. Excluding the results from our run-off Insurance operations, non-operating benefit costs, gains (losses) on purchases and sales of business interests, gains (losses) on equity securities, restructuring costs, separation costs and Russia and Ukraine charges, Adjusted earnings per share* was $2.81. For the year ended December 31, 2023, profit margin was 15.0% and profit was up $11.0 billion, primarily due to an increase in gains on retained and sold ownership interests of $5.7 billion, an increase in segment profit of $2.4 billion, an increase in non-operating benefit income of $1.2 billion, the nonrecurrence of the Steam asset sale impairment of $0.8 billion, the nonrecurrence of debt extinguishment costs of $0.5 billion, a decrease in interest and other financial charges of $0.3 billion, a decrease in Adjusted total corporate operating costs* of $0.1 billion, a decrease in restructuring costs of $0.1 billion and an increase in Insurance profit of $0.1 billion. These increases were partially offset by an increase in separation costs of $0.3 billion. Adjusted organic profit* increased $2.6 billion, driven primarily by increases at all segments and lower Adjusted total corporate operating costs*.
[151]: 2023 FORM 10-K 12
[152]: For the year ended December 31, 2023, segment revenues were up $1.5 billion (9%) and segment profit was up $0.2 billion (19%).
[153]: Revenues increased $1.2 billion (7%) organically*, primarily due to an increase in Gas Power equipment from higher price and scope on Heavy-Duty Gas Turbines and scope on Aeroderivatives, increases in Gas Power and Steam services and increases in Power Conversion services and equipment, partially offset by a reduction in Steam Power equipment due to the ongoing exit of new build coal.
[154]: Profit increased $0.1 billion (10%) organically* primarily due to an increase in Gas Power services volume, price and productivity offsetting inflation.

Property, plant and equipment – net associated with operations based in the United States and outside the United States was approximately 4 % and 3 % and 3 % and 4 % of total continuing assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

[753]: Table element - Text before table: The increase in continuing assets in 2023 was primarily driven by higher cash from net income, the retention of an ownership interest in GEHC, partially offset by cash paid for share redemptions and repurchases and depreciation and amortization on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. Property, plant and equipment – net associated with operations based in the United States and outside the United States was approximately 4 % and 3 % and 3 % and 4 % of total continuing assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
NOTE 26. SUMMARIZED FINANCIAL INFORMATION .
As of September 14, 2023, our investment in AerCap ownership reduced below 20%, and as a result, we no longer have significant influence in AerCap. On November 16, 2023, we sold our remaining equity interest in AerCap and only the note remains outstanding. The fair value of our interest in AerCap, including the note, was $ 944 million and $ 7,403 million, which is included within Investment securities on our Statement of Financial Position at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We recognized a realized pre-tax and after-tax gain of $ 129 million based on several transactions during the year with share prices in the range of $ 55.75 to $ 65.89 , an unrealized pre-tax loss of $ 865 million ($ 1,052 million after-tax) based on a share price of $ 58.32 and an unrealized pre-tax and after-tax gain of $ 711 million based on a share price of $ 65.42 related to our interest in AerCap for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.

[796]: Table element - Text before table: DISAGGREGATION OF REVENUE
We determine operating segments based on how our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) manages the business, makes operating decisions around the allocation of resources, and evaluates operating performance. Our CODM is our Chief Executive Officer, who regularly reviews our operating results on a consolidated basis. We operate as one segment and have one reportable segment. Based on the information provided to and reviewed by our CODM, we believe that the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows and how they are affected by economic factors are most appropriately depicted through our primary geographical markets and types of revenue categories (transaction revenues and revenues from other value added services). Revenues recorded within these categories are earned from similar products and services for which the nature of associated fees and the related revenue recognition models are substantially similar.

[431]: • Revenues from other value added services: Net revenues derived primarily from revenue earned through partnerships, referral fees, subscription fees, gateway fees, and other services we provide to our merchants and consumers. We also earn revenues from interest and fees earned on our portfolio of loans receivable, and interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances.
[432]: Our revenues can be significantly impacted by a number of factors, including the following:
[433]: • The mix of merchants, products, and services;
[434]: • The mix between domestic and cross-border transactions;
[435]: • The geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs; and
[436]: • The amount of our loans receivable outstanding with merchants and consumers.

[795]: The following table presents our revenue disaggregated by primary geographical market and category:
[797]: (1) No single country included in the other countries category generated more than 10% of total net revenues.
[798]: (2) Total net revenues include $ 1.8 billion, $ 1.3 billion, and $ 425 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, which do not represent revenues recognized in the scope of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from contracts with customers. Such revenues relate to interest and fees earned on loans and interest receivable, including loans and interest receivable held for sale, as well as hedging gains or losses, and interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances.
[799]: Net revenues are attributed to the country in which the party paying our fee is located.
[800]: NOTE 3— NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE
[801]: Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive common stock outstanding for the period. The dilutive effect of outstanding equity incentive awards is reflected in diluted net income (loss) per share by application of the treasury stock method. The calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share excludes all anti-dilutive common shares. During periods when we report net loss, diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share because the effects of potentially dilutive items would decrease the net loss per share.
[431]: • Revenues from other value added services: Net revenues derived primarily from revenue earned through partnerships, referral fees, subscription fees, gateway fees, and other services we provide to our merchants and consumers. We also earn revenues from interest and fees earned on our portfolio of loans receivable, and interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances.
[432]: Our revenues can be significantly impacted by a number of factors, including the following:
[433]: • The mix of merchants, products, and services;
[434]: • The mix between domestic and cross-border transactions;
[435]: • The geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs; and
[436]: • The amount of our loans receivable outstanding with merchants and consumers.
[437]: Refer to “Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K for further discussion on factors that may impact our revenue.

[793]: DISAGGREGATION OF REVENUE
[794]: We determine operating segments based on how our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) manages the business, makes operating decisions around the allocation of resources, and evaluates operating performance. Our CODM is our Chief Executive Officer, who regularly reviews our operating results on a consolidated basis. We operate as one segment and have one reportable segment. Based on the information provided to and reviewed by our CODM, we believe that the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows and how they are affected by economic factors are most appropriately depicted through our primary geographical markets and types of revenue categories (transaction revenues and revenues from other value added services). Revenues recorded within these categories are earned from similar products and services for which the nature of associated fees and the related revenue recognition models are substantially similar.

[396]: OVERVIEW OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
[397]: The following table provides a summary of our consolidated financial results for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021:
[399]: All amounts in tables are rounded to the nearest million, except as otherwise noted. As a result, certain amounts may not recalculate using the rounded amounts provided.
[400]: ** Not meaningful.
[401]: Net revenues increased $2.3 billion, or 8%, in 2023 compared to 2022 driven primarily by growth in total payment volume (“TPV”, as defined below under “Key Metrics”) of 13%.
[402]: Total operating expenses increased $1.1 billion, or 4%, in 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to an increase in transaction expense, partially offset by reductions in sales and marketing expense, restructuring and other, and technology and development expense.
[403]: Operating income increased $1.2 billion, or 31%, in 2023 compared to 2022 due to net revenues growing more than operating expenses. Our operating margin was 17% and 14% in 2023 and 2022, respectively, reflecting the positive impact of operating efficiencies in our business and gain on sale of a divested business, partially offset by the negative impact of an increase in transaction expense.

[59]: We earn revenues primarily by charging fees for completing payment transactions for our customers and other payment-related services, which are typically based on the volume of activity processed on our payments platform. We also generate revenue from customers for currency conversion, for instant transfers from their PayPal or Venmo account to their bank account or debit card, and to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies; however, we generally do not charge customers to fund or draw from their accounts. We also earn revenue by providing other value-added services, which primarily comprise revenue earned through partnerships, interest and fees from our merchant and consumer credit products, interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances, referral fees, subscription fees, and gateway services.

[431]: • Revenues from other value added services: Net revenues derived primarily from revenue earned through partnerships, referral fees, subscription fees, gateway fees, and other services we provide to our merchants and consumers. We also earn revenues from interest and fees earned on our portfolio of loans receivable, and interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances.
[432]: Our revenues can be significantly impacted by a number of factors, including the following:
[433]: • The mix of merchants, products, and services;
[434]: • The mix between domestic and cross-border transactions;
[435]: • The geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs; and
[436]: • The amount of our loans receivable outstanding with merchants and consumers.

We determine operating segments based on how our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) manages the business, makes operating decisions around the allocation of resources, and evaluates operating performance. Our CODM is our Chief Executive Officer, who regularly reviews our operating results on a consolidated basis. We operate as one segment and have one reportable segment. Based on the information provided to and reviewed by our CODM, we believe that the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows and how they are affected by economic factors are most appropriately depicted through our primary geographical markets and types of revenue categories (transaction revenues and revenues from other value added services). Revenues recorded within these categories are earned from similar products and services for which the nature of associated fees and the related revenue recognition models are substantially similar.

[796]: Table element - Text before table: DISAGGREGATION OF REVENUE
We determine operating segments based on how our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) manages the business, makes operating decisions around the allocation of resources, and evaluates operating performance. Our CODM is our Chief Executive Officer, who regularly reviews our operating results on a consolidated basis. We operate as one segment and have one reportable segment. Based on the information provided to and reviewed by our CODM, we believe that the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows and how they are affected by economic factors are most appropriately depicted through our primary geographical markets and types of revenue categories (transaction revenues and revenues from other value added services). Revenues recorded within these categories are earned from similar products and services for which the nature of associated fees and the related revenue recognition models are substantially similar.

[431]: • Revenues from other value added services: Net revenues derived primarily from revenue earned through partnerships, referral fees, subscription fees, gateway fees, and other services we provide to our merchants and consumers. We also earn revenues from interest and fees earned on our portfolio of loans receivable, and interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances.
[432]: Our revenues can be significantly impacted by a number of factors, including the following:
[433]: • The mix of merchants, products, and services;
[434]: • The mix between domestic and cross-border transactions;
[435]: • The geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs; and
[436]: • The amount of our loans receivable outstanding with merchants and consumers.
[437]: Refer to “Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K for further discussion on factors that may impact our revenue.

[543]: Table element - Text before table: ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”) defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three levels: Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities as well as certain U.S. Treasury securities that are highly liquid and are actively traded in secondary markets; Level 2 – observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted in active markets, but corroborated by market data; and Level 3 – unobservable inputs that are used when little or no market data is available.  The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs and the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs. In determining fair value, we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible as well as consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment of fair value.
Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value
Financial assets measured at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 consist of interest rate derivatives, which are presented in the table below based on their level in the fair value hierarchy.

[543]: Table element - Text before table: ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”) defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three levels: Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities as well as certain U.S. Treasury securities that are highly liquid and are actively traded in secondary markets; Level 2 – observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted in active markets, but corroborated by market data; and Level 3 – unobservable inputs that are used when little or no market data is available.  The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs and the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs. In determining fair value, we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible as well as consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment of fair value.
Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value
Financial assets measured at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 consist of interest rate derivatives, which are presented in the table below based on their level in the fair value hierarchy.

[543]: Table element - Text before table: ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”) defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three levels: Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities as well as certain U.S. Treasury securities that are highly liquid and are actively traded in secondary markets; Level 2 – observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted in active markets, but corroborated by market data; and Level 3 – unobservable inputs that are used when little or no market data is available.  The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs and the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs. In determining fair value, we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible as well as consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment of fair value.

                    The question is: What are the revenues for the 12 month period ending december 2023 (in million USD)?  possible values: any number (positive or negative, including decimals) 

                    
                     


                    Your answer should be formatted as a JSON object, under the key 'main_question' you can put as value the answer to the question in the designated format. Under the key 'sources', you should also provide the numbers of the text fragments you used to answer the question.

[543]: Table element - Text before table: ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”) defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three levels: Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities as well as certain U.S. Treasury securities that are highly liquid and are actively traded in secondary markets; Level 2 – observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted in active markets, but corroborated by market data; and Level 3 – unobservable inputs that are used when little or no market data is available.  The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs and the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs. In determining fair value, we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible as well as consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment of fair value.
Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value
Financial assets measured at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 consist of interest rate derivatives, which are presented in the table below based on their level in the fair value hierarchy.

[515]: • “Organic revenue” is defined as revenue, excluding the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations and acquisitions. The period-over-period change resulting from foreign currency fluctuations is estimated using a fixed exchange rate for both the current and prior periods. Management believes that reporting organic revenue provides useful information to investors by facilitating comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers.

Special items represent charges or credits that impact current results, which management views as unrelated to the Company’s ongoing operations and performance. “Adjusted operating margin” is defined as adjusted operating income (loss) divided by revenue. We believe that these financial measures are useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating ongoing operating profitability, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors.
[667]: Given the Company’s decentralized structure and geographic dispersion of the Company’s business units, auditing revenue recognized at a point in time required significant audit effort for us to identify, test, and evaluate the Company’s revenue recognition.

[669]: To address this critical audit matter, we performed the following procedures to test revenue recognized at a point in time, among others:
[670]: 52
[671]: • Obtained an understanding of the Company’s geographic composition of revenue and used judgment to determine which business units to perform revenue recognition procedures on.
[672]: • Obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company’s relevant controls at certain business units to determine the appropriate revenue recognition.
[673]: • Performed site visits of selected business units across various geographies to perform revenue recognition testing and observe the Company's process, products, and arrangements.

The lower the number of the fragment, the earlier the fragment appeared in the document (reading from left to right, top to bottom).  


                    The question is: What are the revenues for the 12 month period ending december 2023?  possible values: any number (positive or negative, including decimals)
 We also want to retrieve some meta information. In the following we will present the meta item ID and then the additional question to be answered, format: (META_ID): QUESTION.
(currency): What is the currency  possible values (select one from json array): ['USD', 'EUR', 'Other']
(unit): What is the unit?  possible values (select one from json array): ['none', 'thousands', 'millions', 'billions']

For the main question use the key 'main_question', for the meta items use their ID as key. Under the key 'sources', you should also provide the numbers of the text fragments you used to answer the question.

[763]: Table element - Text before table: Business Combinations In October 2021, the FASB issued amended guidance on accounting for contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers in a business combination. The guidance is intended to address inconsistency related to recognition of an acquired contract liability and payment terms and their effect on subsequent revenue recognized. At the acquisition date, an entity should account for the related revenue contracts in accordance with existing revenue recognition guidance generally by assessing how the acquiree applied recognition and measurement in their financial statements. The guidance was adopted on January 1, 2023 and the adoption did not have an impact to the consolidated financial statements. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted Income Taxes In December 2023, the FASB issued amended guidance on income tax disclosures. The guidance is intended to provide additional disaggregation to the effective income tax rate reconciliation and income tax payment disclosures. The amended guidance is effective for annual periods beginning January 2025 and should be applied on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. Segment Reporting In November 2023, the FASB issued amended guidance for improvements to reportable segment disclosures. The revised guidance requires that a public entity disclose significant segment expenses regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (CODM), including public entities with a single reportable segment. The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning January 2024 and interim periods beginning January 2025 on a retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted.

[761]: Note 2. REVENUE
[762]: The following table summarizes the disaggregation of revenue by nature:
[764]: Net product sales represent more than 95 % of total revenues for all periods presented. Products are sold principally to wholesalers, distributors, specialty pharmacies, and to a lesser extent, directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics and government agencies. Customer orders are generally fulfilled within a few days of receipt resulting in minimal order backlog. Contractual performance obligations are usually limited to transfer of control of the product to the customer. The transfer occurs either upon shipment, upon receipt of the product after considering when the customer obtains legal title to the product, or upon infusion for cell therapies and when BMS obtains a right of payment. At these points, customers are able to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits of the product.
[765]: Gross revenue to the three largest pharmaceutical wholesalers in the U.S. as a percentage of U.S. gross revenues was as follows:
[536]: Table element - Text before table: Our non-U.S. businesses have significantly more direct customers. Information on available direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information varies widely. We limit our direct customer sales channel inventory reporting to where we can influence demand. When this information does not exist or is otherwise not available, we have developed a variety of methodologies to estimate such data, including using historical sales made to direct customers and third-party market research data related to prescription trends and end-user demand. Given the difficulties inherent in estimating third-party demand information, we evaluate our methodologies to estimate direct customer product level inventory and to calculate months on hand on an ongoing basis and make changes as necessary. Factors that may affect our estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, price increases, new product launches, new warehouse openings by direct customers, new customer stockings by direct customers and expected direct customer purchases for governmental bidding situations. As such, all of the information required to estimate months on hand in the direct customer distribution channel for non-U.S. business for the year ended December 31, 2023 is not available prior to the filing of this 2023 Form 10-K. We will disclose any product with levels of inventory in excess of one month on hand or expected demand for the current quarter, subject to certain limited exceptions, in our next quarterly report on Form 10-Q.

[415]: Table element - Text before table: In January 2024, we acquired Mirati, a commercial stage targeted oncology company with a pipeline of commercial, clinical and pre-clinical stage oncology medicines and assets. With the Mirati acquisition, we obtained rights to Krazati *, a best-in-class inhibitor of KRASG12C mutation, approved by the FDA as a second-line treatment for patients with NSCLC; and MRTX1719, a potential first-in-class MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitor in Phase I development, among others. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2023, we entered into definitive merger agreements to acquire Karuna and RayzeBio and also entered into strategic collaboration with SystImmune. Karuna is a biopharmaceutical company driven to discover, develop and deliver transformative medicines for people living with psychiatric and neurological conditions. RayzeBio is a clinical-stage radiopharmaceutical therapeutics company with an innovation-leading position in actinium-based radiopharmaceutical therapeutics and a pipeline of potentially first-in-class and best-in-class drug development programs. Refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 4. Acquisitions, Divestitures, Licensing and Other Arrangements” for additional information. The goal of the collaboration with SystImmune is to co-develop and co-commercialize BL-B01D1, a bispecific topoisomerase inhibitor-based anti-body drug conjugate which targets both EGFR and HER3 and is currently being evaluated in a Phase I clinical trial for metastatic or unresectable NSCLC. Refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 3. Alliances” for further information.
The Company has the potential to increase its registrational portfolio from six to up to twelve potentially first-in-class/best-in-class assets. In addition to its growing registrational portfolio, the Company has more than 25 indication expansion opportunities on the horizon. Taken together, this leads to increased depth across the Company’s therapeutic areas, including oncology, hematology, immunology, cardiovascular and a growing presence in neuroscience.

[763]: Table element - Text before table: Business Combinations In October 2021, the FASB issued amended guidance on accounting for contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers in a business combination. The guidance is intended to address inconsistency related to recognition of an acquired contract liability and payment terms and their effect on subsequent revenue recognized. At the acquisition date, an entity should account for the related revenue contracts in accordance with existing revenue recognition guidance generally by assessing how the acquiree applied recognition and measurement in their financial statements. The guidance was adopted on January 1, 2023 and the adoption did not have an impact to the consolidated financial statements. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted Income Taxes In December 2023, the FASB issued amended guidance on income tax disclosures. The guidance is intended to provide additional disaggregation to the effective income tax rate reconciliation and income tax payment disclosures. The amended guidance is effective for annual periods beginning January 2025 and should be applied on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. Segment Reporting In November 2023, the FASB issued amended guidance for improvements to reportable segment disclosures. The revised guidance requires that a public entity disclose significant segment expenses regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (CODM), including public entities with a single reportable segment. The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning January 2024 and interim periods beginning January 2025 on a retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted.

[56]: Table element - Text before table: We operate in one segment engaged in the discovery, development, licensing, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sale of biopharmaceutical products on a global basis. We expect that our planned acquisitions of Karuna and RayzeBio, announced during the fourth quarter of 2023, as well as the Mirati (2024) and the Turning Point (2022) acquisitions, will continue to position us as a leading biopharmaceutical company, expanding our targeted oncology portfolio, as well as other therapeutic areas, including neuroscience. Our principal strategy is to combine the resources, scale and capability of a pharmaceutical company with the speed and focus on innovation of the biotech industry. Our focus as a biopharmaceutical company is on discovering, developing and delivering transformational medicines for patients facing serious diseases in areas where we believe that we have an opportunity to make a meaningful difference: oncology, hematology, immunology, cardiovascular and neuroscience. Our priorities are to continue renewing and diversifying our portfolio, advancing our early, mid and late-stage pipeline, and executing disciplined business development. We remain committed to strengthening our balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders. For a further discussion of our strategy initiatives, refer to “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Strategy.”
We compete with other worldwide research-based drug companies, smaller research companies and generic drug manufacturers. Our products are sold worldwide, primarily to wholesalers, distributors, specialty pharmacies, and to a lesser extent, directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics and government agencies. We have significant manufacturing operations in the U.S., Puerto Rico, Switzerland, Ireland, and the Netherlands. Most of our revenues come from products in the following therapeutic classes: hematology, oncology, cardiovascular and immunology.

[1057]: Table element - Text before table: MSUs are granted to executive officers. Vesting is conditioned upon continuous employment and occurs ratably over four years , subject to accelerated vesting in specified circumstances. The number of shares issued upon vesting of MSUs is determined based on a specified payout factor requiring that the market price per share at a specified measurement date be at least 80 % of the grant-date share price (market condition) for awards granted in 2023 ( 60 % prior to 2022). Attainment of a higher payout factor, calculated as the share price on measurement date divided by share price on award date, results in a higher percentage payout of MSUs, up to a maximum of 225 % of the target number of MSUs for awards granted in 2023 ( 200 % prior to 2022). The share price used in the payout factor is calculated using an average of the closing prices on the grant date or measurement date, and the nine trading days immediately preceding the grant date or measurement date.
PSUs are granted to executive officers, have a three-year performance cycle and are granted as a target number of stock units subject to adjustment.

[763]: Table element - Text before table: Business Combinations In October 2021, the FASB issued amended guidance on accounting for contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers in a business combination. The guidance is intended to address inconsistency related to recognition of an acquired contract liability and payment terms and their effect on subsequent revenue recognized. At the acquisition date, an entity should account for the related revenue contracts in accordance with existing revenue recognition guidance generally by assessing how the acquiree applied recognition and measurement in their financial statements. The guidance was adopted on January 1, 2023 and the adoption did not have an impact to the consolidated financial statements. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted Income Taxes In December 2023, the FASB issued amended guidance on income tax disclosures. The guidance is intended to provide additional disaggregation to the effective income tax rate reconciliation and income tax payment disclosures. The amended guidance is effective for annual periods beginning January 2025 and should be applied on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. Segment Reporting In November 2023, the FASB issued amended guidance for improvements to reportable segment disclosures. The revised guidance requires that a public entity disclose significant segment expenses regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (CODM), including public entities with a single reportable segment. The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning January 2024 and interim periods beginning January 2025 on a retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted.

[56]: Table element - Text before table: We operate in one segment engaged in the discovery, development, licensing, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sale of biopharmaceutical products on a global basis. We expect that our planned acquisitions of Karuna and RayzeBio, announced during the fourth quarter of 2023, as well as the Mirati (2024) and the Turning Point (2022) acquisitions, will continue to position us as a leading biopharmaceutical company, expanding our targeted oncology portfolio, as well as other therapeutic areas, including neuroscience. Our principal strategy is to combine the resources, scale and capability of a pharmaceutical company with the speed and focus on innovation of the biotech industry. Our focus as a biopharmaceutical company is on discovering, developing and delivering transformational medicines for patients facing serious diseases in areas where we believe that we have an opportunity to make a meaningful difference: oncology, hematology, immunology, cardiovascular and neuroscience. Our priorities are to continue renewing and diversifying our portfolio, advancing our early, mid and late-stage pipeline, and executing disciplined business development. We remain committed to strengthening our balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders. For a further discussion of our strategy initiatives, refer to “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Strategy.”
We compete with other worldwide research-based drug companies, smaller research companies and generic drug manufacturers. Our products are sold worldwide, primarily to wholesalers, distributors, specialty pharmacies, and to a lesser extent, directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics and government agencies. We have significant manufacturing operations in the U.S., Puerto Rico, Switzerland, Ireland, and the Netherlands. Most of our revenues come from products in the following therapeutic classes: hematology, oncology, cardiovascular and immunology.

[1420]: Segment Assets
[1421]: We manage our assets on a total company basis, not by operating segment. Therefore, our chief operating decision maker does not regularly review any asset information by operating segment and, accordingly, we do not report asset information by operating segment. Total assets were approximately $ 14.3 billion and $ 14.9 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
[1422]: Selected Statement of Income Information
[1424]: (a) Certain production facilities are shared. Depreciation and amortization is allocated to the reportable operating segments based on estimates of where the benefits of the related assets are realized.
[1425]: (b) Revenue denominated in euros was $ 853 million in 2023, $ 774 million in 2022 and $ 814 million in 2021.

[1417]: • Corporate , includes enabling functions such as information technology, facilities, legal, finance, human resources, business development, certain diagnostic costs and communications, among others. These costs also include certain compensation costs, certain procurement costs and other miscellaneous operating expenses not charged to our operating segments, as well as interest income and expense.
[1418]: •    Certain transactions and events such as (i) Purchase accounting adjustments , where we incur expenses associated with the amortization of fair value adjustments to inventory, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment; (ii) Acquisition-related activities , where we incur costs associated with acquiring and integrating newly acquired businesses, such as transaction costs and integration costs; and (iii) Certain significant items , which comprise substantive, unusual items that, either as a result of their nature or size, would not be expected to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis, such as restructuring charges and implementation costs associated with our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives that are not associated with an acquisition, certain asset impairment charges, certain legal and commercial settlements and the impact of divestiture-related gains and losses.
[692]: Operational Growth
[693]: We believe that it is important to not only understand overall revenue and earnings growth, but also “operational growth.” Operational growth is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as revenue or earnings growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This measure provides information on the change in revenue and earnings as if foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the current and prior periods to facilitate a period-to-period comparison. We believe this non-GAAP measure provides a useful comparison to previous periods for the company and investors, but should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP reported growth.
[694]: Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share
[695]: Adjusted net income and the corresponding adjusted earnings per share (EPS) are non-GAAP financial measures of performance used by management. We believe these financial measures are useful supplemental information to investors when considered together with our U.S. GAAP financial measures. We report adjusted net income to portray the results of our major operations, and the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization of our products, prior to considering certain income statement elements. We define adjusted net income and adjusted EPS as net income attributable to Zoetis and EPS before the impact of purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items.
[701]: (a) Amortization expense related to finite-lived acquired intangible assets that contribute to our ability to sell, manufacture, research, market and distribute products, compounds and intellectual property is included in Amortization of intangible assets as these intangible assets benefit multiple business functions. Amortization expense related to finite-lived acquired intangible assets that are associated with a single function is included in Cost of sales , Selling, general and administrative expenses or Research and development expenses , as appropriate.

[707]: On a global basis, the mix of revenue between companion animal and livestock products was as follows:
[709]: 2023 vs. 2022
[710]: Total revenue increased by $464 million, or 6%, in 2023 compared with 2022 reflecting operational revenue growth of $579 million, or 7%. Operational revenue growth was primarily due to the following:
[711]: • price growth of approximately 5%; and
[712]: • volume growth from new products of approximately 2%.

[833]: Table element - Text before table: The lower effective tax rate for 2023, compared with 2022, was primarily attributable to a higher benefit in the U.S. related to foreign-derived intangible income, a more favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings (which includes the impact of the location of earnings and repatriation costs), partially offset by a higher net discrete tax expense in 2023, mainly related to changes to prior years’ tax positions. Jurisdictional mix of earnings can vary depending on repatriation decisions, operating fluctuations in the normal course of business and the impact of non-deductible and non-taxable items.
The higher effective tax rate for 2022, compared with 2021, was attributable to a less favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings (which includes the impact of the location of earnings and repatriation costs), a lower benefit in the U.S. related to foreign-derived intangible income and lower net discrete tax benefits in 2022.

[699]: Table element - Text before table: We recognize that, as an internal measure of performance, the adjusted net income and adjusted EPS measures have limitations, and we do not restrict our performance management process solely to these metrics. A limitation of the adjusted net income and adjusted EPS measures is that they provide a view of our operations without including all events during a period, such as the effects of an acquisition or amortization of purchased intangibles, and do not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies. The adjusted net income and adjusted EPS measures are not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for U.S. GAAP reported net income attributable to Zoetis and reported EPS.

[699]: Table element - Text before table: We recognize that, as an internal measure of performance, the adjusted net income and adjusted EPS measures have limitations, and we do not restrict our performance management process solely to these metrics. A limitation of the adjusted net income and adjusted EPS measures is that they provide a view of our operations without including all events during a period, such as the effects of an acquisition or amortization of purchased intangibles, and do not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies. The adjusted net income and adjusted EPS measures are not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for U.S. GAAP reported net income attributable to Zoetis and reported EPS.

The fragments start with a number in square brackets and then the actual text. The lower the number of the fragment, the earlier the fragment appeared in the document (reading from left to right, top to bottom).  


                    The question is: What are the revenues for the 12 month period ending december 2023?  possible values: any number (positive or negative, including decimals)
 We also want to retrieve some meta information. In the following we will present the meta item ID and then the additional question to be answered, format: (META_ID): QUESTION.
(currency): What is the currency  possible values (select one from json array): ['USD', 'EUR', 'Other']
(unit): What is the unit?  possible values (select one from json array): ['none', 'thousands', 'millions', 'billions'] 

                    
                     


                    Your answer should be formatted as a JSON object. Under the key 'answers' can be one or more JSON object(s), with key value pairs for the main question and the meta items. For the main question use the key 'main_question', for the meta items use their ID as key. Under the key 'sources', you should also provide the numbers of the text fragments you used to answer the question. For example your answer could look like this: {""answers"": [{""main_question"": ""123"", ""currency"": ""USD"", ""unit"": ""none""}], ""sources"": [241, 423]}

Restricted cash includes amounts that cannot be withdrawn or used for general operating activities under legal or regulatory restrictions. Restricted cash consists of amounts deposited by customers for prepaid card transactions and funds held as a liquidity reserve that are subject to local regulatory restrictions requiring appropriate segregation and restriction in their use. Restricted cash is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding liability in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. We regularly maintain cash balances with financial institutions in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit or the equivalent outside the U.S. As of December 31, 2023 , approximately 75 % of our total balance of cash and cash equivalents was held within a small group of financial institutions, primarily large money center banks. Although we currently believe that the financial institutions with whom we do business will be able to fulfill their commitments to us, there is no assurance that those institutions will be able to continue to do so. We have not experienced any losses associated with our balances in such accounts for the year ended December 31, 2023, 2022 or 2021 .

[1053]: Information on segments and reconciliations to consolidated revenues, consolidated operating income and consolidated depreciation and amortization was as follows:
[1055]: (1) Revenues, operating income and depreciation and amortization reflect the effects of acquired businesses from the respective acquisition dates and the effects of divested businesses through the respective disposal dates. See “Note 2—Acquisition” and “Note 3—Business Dispositions” for further discussion.
[1056]: During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, operating income included acquisition and integration expenses of $ 341.9 million, $ 259.2 million, and $ 340.4 million, respectively, which were primarily included within Corporate expenses. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, operating loss for Corporate also included $ 18.5 million, $ 47.1 million, and $ 56.8 million, respectively, of other charges related to facilities exit activities.
[1057]: Entity-Wide Information
[1058]: As a percentage of our total consolidated revenues, revenues from external customers in the United States were 76 % for the year ended December 31, 2023, 80 % for the year ended December 31, 2022, and 79 % for the year ended December 31, 2021. Revenues from external customers are attributed to individual countries based on the location of the customer arrangements. Our results of operations and our financial condition are not significantly reliant upon any single customer.
[509]: The following table sets forth key selected financial data for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, this data as a percentage of total revenues, and the changes between periods in dollars and as a percentage of the prior-period amount. The income statement data for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 is derived from the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in ""Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.""

[502]: Operating Income and Operating Margin
[503]: For the purpose of discussing segment operations, we refer to ""operating income,"" which is calculated by subtracting segment direct expenses from segment revenues. Overhead and shared expenses, including share-based compensation, are not allocated to segment operations; they are reported in the caption ""Corporate."" Impairment of goodwill and gains or losses on business dispositions are also not included in determining segment operating income. In addition, in discussing segment operations we refer to ""operating margin,"" which is calculated by dividing segment operating income by segment revenues.
[504]: Equity in Income of Equity Method Investments
[505]: We have equity method investments, including a 45% interest in China UnionPay Data Co., Ltd., which we account for using the equity method of accounting. Equity in income of equity method investments reflects our proportional share of earnings from these investments.

[515]: (3) For the year ended December 31, 2022, consolidated operating income included an $833.1 million goodwill impairment charge related to our former Business and Consumer Solutions reporting unit. See “Note 6—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” for further discussion.

[517]: Table of Contents
[518]: Revenues
[519]: Consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by 7.6% to $9,654.4 million, compared to $8,975.5 million for the prior year. The increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in transaction volumes, including from the EVO business acquired in 2023.
[520]: Merchant Solutions Segment. Revenues from our Merchant Solutions segment for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by 15.3% to $7,151.8 million, compared to $6,204.9 million for the prior year. The increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in transaction volumes, including from the EVO business, and growth in subscription and software revenue.
[521]: Issuer Solutions Segment. Revenues from our Issuer Solutions segment for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by 6.8% to $2,398.9 million, compared to $2,245.6 million for the prior year. The increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in transaction volumes.
[529]: Consolidated operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2022 included the unfavorable effects of an $833.1 million goodwill impairment charge related to our former Business and Consumer Solutions reporting unit and a $127.2 million loss related to the sale of our Merchant Solutions business in Russia. We also recognized charges within loss on business dispositions in our consolidated statement of income of $71.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 to reduce the consumer business disposal group to estimated fair value less costs to sell.
[530]: 42
[531]: Table of Contents
[532]: Segment Operating Income and Operating Margin
[533]: In our Merchant Solutions segment, operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased compared to the prior year primarily due to the favorable effect of the increase in revenues, since certain fixed costs do not vary with revenues, and continued expense management. These favorable effects were partially offset by incremental expenses related to continued investment in products, innovation and our technology environments. In addition, the inclusion of EVO had an unfavorable effect on the Merchant Solutions operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the prior year.

[669]: ITEM 8 - FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
[670]: REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
[671]: To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Global Payments Inc.
[672]: Opinion on the Financial Statements
[673]: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Global Payments Inc. and subsidiaries (the ""Company"") as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the ""financial statements""). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
[525]: Selling, general and administrative expenses included acquisition and integration expenses of $341.4 million and $258.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Share-based compensation expense was $209.0 million and $163.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
[526]: Corporate. Corporate expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $898.0 million, compared to $777.7 million for the prior year. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to the increase in acquisition and integration and compensation expenses, partially offset by lower charges related to facilities exit activities in the current year.
[527]: Operating Income and Operating Margin
[528]: Consolidated operating income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $1,716.4 million, compared to $640.2 million for the prior year. Consolidated operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year included the favorable effects of the increase in revenues, since certain fixed costs do not vary with revenues, prudent expense management and lower charges related to facilities exit activities as described above. These effects were partially offset by higher acquisition and integration expenses, amortization of acquired intangibles and compensation expenses as described above. Consolidated operating income for the year ended December 31, 2023 also included the effects of a $106.9 million gain on the sale of our gaming business and a $243.6 million loss on the sale of our consumer business.
[499]: Operating Expenses
[500]: Cost of Service. Cost of service consists primarily of salaries, wages and related expenses paid to operations and technology-related personnel, including those who monitor our transaction processing systems and settlement functions; the cost of transaction processing systems, including third-party services; the cost of network telecommunications capability; depreciation and occupancy costs associated with the facilities supporting these functions; amortization of intangible assets; costs to fulfill customer contracts; provisions for operating losses; and, when applicable, integration costs.
[501]: Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, wages, commissions and related expenses paid to sales personnel, customer support functions other than those supporting revenues, administrative employees and management; share-based compensation; costs to obtain customer contracts; residuals paid to ISOs; fees paid to VARs, independent contractors and other third parties; other selling expenses; occupancy costs of leased space directly related to these functions; advertising costs; and, when applicable, acquisition and integration costs.
[623]: When applying the quantitative assessment, we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighted average of multiple valuation techniques, principally a combination of an income approach and a market approach. The income approach calculates a value based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows, while the market approach uses earnings multiples of similarly situated guideline public companies. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions .
[624]: During the second quarter of 2022, the sustained decline in our share price and increases in discount rates, primarily resulting from increased economic uncertainty, indicated a potential decline in fair value and triggered a requirement to evaluate our Issuer Solutions and former Business and Consumer Solutions reporting units for potential impairment as of June 30, 2022. Furthermore, the estimated sales price for the consumer business portion of our former Business and Consumer Solutions reporting unit also indicated a potential decline in fair value as of June 30, 2022. We determined on the basis of the quantitative assessment that the fair value of our Issuer Solutions reporting unit was still greater than its carrying amount, indicating no impairment. Based on the quantitative assessment of our former Business and Consumer Solutions reporting unit, including consideration of the consumer business disposal group and the remaining assets of the reporting unit, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $833.1 million in our consolidated statement of income during the three months ended June 30, 2022.

Restricted cash includes amounts that cannot be withdrawn or used for general operating activities under legal or regulatory restrictions. Restricted cash consists of amounts deposited by customers for prepaid card transactions and funds held as a liquidity reserve that are subject to local regulatory restrictions requiring appropriate segregation and restriction in their use. Restricted cash is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding liability in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. We regularly maintain cash balances with financial institutions in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit or the equivalent outside the U.S. As of December 31, 2023 , approximately 75 % of our total balance of cash and cash equivalents was held within a small group of financial institutions, primarily large money center banks. Although we currently believe that the financial institutions with whom we do business will be able to fulfill their commitments to us, there is no assurance that those institutions will be able to continue to do so. We have not experienced any losses associated with our balances in such accounts for the year ended December 31, 2023, 2022 or 2021 .

Restricted cash includes amounts that cannot be withdrawn or used for general operating activities under legal or regulatory restrictions. Restricted cash consists of amounts deposited by customers for prepaid card transactions and funds held as a liquidity reserve that are subject to local regulatory restrictions requiring appropriate segregation and restriction in their use. Restricted cash is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding liability in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. We regularly maintain cash balances with financial institutions in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit or the equivalent outside the U.S. As of December 31, 2023 , approximately 75 % of our total balance of cash and cash equivalents was held within a small group of financial institutions, primarily large money center banks. Although we currently believe that the financial institutions with whom we do business will be able to fulfill their commitments to us, there is no assurance that those institutions will be able to continue to do so. We have not experienced any losses associated with our balances in such accounts for the year ended December 31, 2023, 2022 or 2021 .

[690]: Table element - Text before table: During 2021, the Company could transfer up to $ 200 million of certain receivables. During 2022, the program was amended to increase the transfer limit up to $ 350 million of certain receivables.
At December 31, 2023, and 2022 the bankruptcy-remote subsidiary held receivables of $ 674 million and $ 458 million, respectively, which are included in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The receivables held by the bankruptcy-remote subsidiary collateralize the outstanding receivables sold, which was $ 20 million and $ 80 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The transfers are recorded at the fair value of the proceeds received and obligations assumed less derecognized receivables. No obligation was recorded at December 31, 2023 or 2022 as the estimated expected credit losses on receivables sold is insignificant. Our maximum exposure to loss related to these receivables transferred is limited to the amount outstanding.

The fragments start with a number in square brackets and then the actual text. The lower the number of the fragment, the earlier the fragment appeared in the document (reading from left to right, top to bottom).  


                    The question is: What are the revenues for the 12 month period ending december 2023?  possible values: any number (positive or negative, including decimals)
 We also want to retrieve some meta information. In the following we will present the meta item ID and then the additional question to be answered, format: (META_ID): QUESTION.
(currency): What is the currency  possible values (select one from json array): ['USD', 'EUR', 'Other']
(unit): What is the unit?  possible values (select one from json array): ['none', 'thousands', 'millions', 'billions'] 

                    
                     


                    Your answer should be formatted as a JSON object. Under the key 'answers' can be one or more JSON object(s), with key value pairs for the main question and the meta items. For the main question use the key 'main_question', for the meta items use their ID as key. Under the key 'sources', you should also provide the numbers of the text fragments you used to answer the question. For example your answer could look like this: {""answers"": [{""main_question"": ""123"", ""currency"": ""USD"", ""unit"": ""none""}], ""sources"": [241, 423]}

[690]: Table element - Text before table: During 2021, the Company could transfer up to $ 200 million of certain receivables. During 2022, the program was amended to increase the transfer limit up to $ 350 million of certain receivables.
At December 31, 2023, and 2022 the bankruptcy-remote subsidiary held receivables of $ 674 million and $ 458 million, respectively, which are included in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The receivables held by the bankruptcy-remote subsidiary collateralize the outstanding receivables sold, which was $ 20 million and $ 80 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The transfers are recorded at the fair value of the proceeds received and obligations assumed less derecognized receivables. No obligation was recorded at December 31, 2023 or 2022 as the estimated expected credit losses on receivables sold is insignificant. Our maximum exposure to loss related to these receivables transferred is limited to the amount outstanding.

[619]: You should read this Annual Report with the understanding that our actual future results, levels of activity, performance and events and circumstances may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.
[620]: Certain numerical figures included in this Annual Report have been subject to rounding adjustments. Accordingly, such numerical figures shown as totals in various tables may not be arithmetic aggregations of the figures that precede them.
[621]: Organization of Information
[622]: Management’s Discussion and Analysis provides a narrative on our financial performance and condition that should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements and accompanying notes thereto. It includes the following sections:
[623]: • Our Business
[624]: • Key Factors Impacting Operating Results and Financial Condition
[625]: • Consolidated Results of Operations
[626]: • Non-GAAP Financial Measures
[627]: • Reconciliation of CSC Holdings Results of Operations to Altice USA's Results of Operations
[974]: We identified the evaluation of goodwill for impairment for the News and Advertising and Telecommunications reporting units as a critical audit matter. Challenging auditor judgment and involvement of valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge were required to evaluate certain assumptions used to estimate the fair value of these reporting units, such as revenue growth rates, long-term growth rates, and discount rates. Changes in these assumptions could have had a significant impact on the Company’s assessment of each reporting unit’s carrying value of goodwill.
[975]: The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the annual goodwill impairment testing. This included controls related to the Company’s development of revenue growth rates, long-term growth rates, and discount rates. We performed sensitivity analyses over the revenue growth rate, long-term growth rate,
[635]: Key Factors Impacting Operating Results and Financial Condition
[636]: Our future performance is dependent, to a large extent, on the impact of direct competition, general economic conditions (including capital and credit market conditions), our ability to manage our businesses effectively, and our relative strength and leverage in the marketplace, both with suppliers and customers. For more information, see ""Risk Factors"" and ""Business-Competition"" included herein.
[637]: We derive revenue principally through monthly charges to residential customers of our broadband, video, telephony and mobile services. We also derive revenue from DVR, VOD, pay-per-view, installation and home shopping commissions. Our residential broadband, video, telephony and mobile services accounted for approximately 41%, 33%, 3%, and 1% respectively, of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. We also derive revenue from the sale of a wide and growing variety of products and services to both large enterprise and SMB customers, including broadband, telephony, networking, video and mobile services. For the year ended December 31, 2023, 16% of our consolidated revenue was derived from these business services. In addition, we derive revenue from the sale of advertising inventory available on the programming carried on our cable television systems, as well as other systems (linear revenue), digital advertising, data analytics and affiliation fees for news programming, which accounted for approximately 5% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our other revenue, which includes mobile equipment revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2023 accounted for approximately 1% of our consolidated revenue.
[1316]: NOTE 16. AFFILIATE AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
[1317]: Affiliate and Related Party Transactions Altice USA is controlled by Patrick Drahi through Next Alt who also controls Altice Europe and other entities. As the transactions discussed below were conducted between entities under common control by Mr. Drahi, amounts charged for certain services may not have represented amounts that might have been received or incurred if the transactions were based upon arm's length negotiations.

[1320]: The following table summarizes the revenue and expenses related to services provided to or received from affiliates and related parties:
[1322]: Revenue
[1323]: We recognize revenue primarily from the sale of advertising to a subsidiary of Altice Europe and in 2021 we also recognized revenue from a foundation controlled by Mr. Drahi.
[1324]: Programming and other direct costs
[1325]: Programming and other direct costs include costs incurred for advertising services provided by Teads S.A., a subsidiary of Altice Europe.

[953]: The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the annual goodwill impairment testing. This included controls related to the Company’s development of revenue growth rates, long-term growth rates, and discount rates. We performed sensitivity analyses over the revenue growth rate, long-term growth rate, and discount rate assumptions used in the Company’s estimates of the fair values of the News and Advertising and Telecommunications reporting units. We evaluated the Company’s revenue growth rate assumptions for each reporting unit by comparing them to each reporting unit’s historical revenue growth rates. We compared the Company’s historical revenue forecasts to actual results to assess the Company’s ability to accurately forecast. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:
[954]: • evaluating the long-term growth rates by independently developing long-term growth rate ranges using publicly available market data and comparing them to the Company’s long-term growth rates

[979]: • evaluating the discount rates by independently developing discount rate ranges using publicly available market data for comparable entities and comparing them to the Company’s discount rate for each reporting unit
[980]: • developing an estimated range of fair value for each reporting unit using the Company’s cash flow projections and the independently developed discount rate ranges and long-term growth rates and compared the results to the Company’s fair value estimates.

(unit): What is the unit?  possible values (select one from json array): ['none', 'thousands', 'millions', 'billions'] 

                    
                     


                    Your answer should be formatted as a JSON object. Under the key 'answers' can be one or more JSON object(s), with key value pairs for the main question and the meta items. For the main question use the key 'main_question', for the meta items use their ID as key. Under the key 'sources', you should also provide the numbers of the text fragments you used to answer the question. For example your answer could look like this: {""answers"": [{""main_question"": ""123"", ""currency"": ""USD"", ""unit"": ""none""}], ""sources"": [241, 423]}

[1366]: Table element - Text before table: Foreign Currency Forward Contracts . We also use foreign currency forward contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities. As a result of foreign currency fluctuations, the U.S. Dollar equivalent values of our foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities change. Gains and losses on these contracts are included in other income (expense), on a net basis, along with the foreign currency gains and losses of the related foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities associated with these foreign currency forward contracts. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the total notional amounts of these foreign currency contracts were $ 3.1 billion and $ 3.0 billion, respectively.
Cross-currency Interest Rate Swaps. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we elected to de-designate a portion of our cross-currency interest rate swaps previously designated as net investment hedges. Gains and losses subsequent to the de-designation will be recognized in earnings to offset remeasurement gains and losses from foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities. We also entered into $ 283.4 million of cross-currency interest rate swaps, which were not designated as hedging instruments. As of December 31, 2023, the total notional amount of cross-currency interest rate swaps which were not designated as hedging instruments was $ 1.1 billion.

For additional information, see “Maturities of Lease Liabilities” in Note 10 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.
[940]: Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
[941]: Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. Management bases its assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results may differ from these assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.

[1366]: Table element - Text before table: Foreign Currency Forward Contracts . We also use foreign currency forward contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities. As a result of foreign currency fluctuations, the U.S. Dollar equivalent values of our foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities change. Gains and losses on these contracts are included in other income (expense), on a net basis, along with the foreign currency gains and losses of the related foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities associated with these foreign currency forward contracts. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the total notional amounts of these foreign currency contracts were $ 3.1 billion and $ 3.0 billion, respectively.
Cross-currency Interest Rate Swaps. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we elected to de-designate a portion of our cross-currency interest rate swaps previously designated as net investment hedges. Gains and losses subsequent to the de-designation will be recognized in earnings to offset remeasurement gains and losses from foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities. We also entered into $ 283.4 million of cross-currency interest rate swaps, which were not designated as hedging instruments. As of December 31, 2023, the total notional amount of cross-currency interest rate swaps which were not designated as hedging instruments was $ 1.1 billion.

[1366]: Table element - Text before table: Foreign Currency Forward Contracts . We also use foreign currency forward contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities. As a result of foreign currency fluctuations, the U.S. Dollar equivalent values of our foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities change. Gains and losses on these contracts are included in other income (expense), on a net basis, along with the foreign currency gains and losses of the related foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities associated with these foreign currency forward contracts. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the total notional amounts of these foreign currency contracts were $ 3.1 billion and $ 3.0 billion, respectively.
Cross-currency Interest Rate Swaps. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we elected to de-designate a portion of our cross-currency interest rate swaps previously designated as net investment hedges. Gains and losses subsequent to the de-designation will be recognized in earnings to offset remeasurement gains and losses from foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities. We also entered into $ 283.4 million of cross-currency interest rate swaps, which were not designated as hedging instruments. As of December 31, 2023, the total notional amount of cross-currency interest rate swaps which were not designated as hedging instruments was $ 1.1 billion.

The Company is subject to U.K. corporate taxation.  Due to the nature of its business, the Company has generated losses since inception and therefore not paid U.K. corporation tax. The provision for (benefit
[1574]: F-44
[1575]: Table of Contents from) income taxes included in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss represents the tax impact from operating activities in the United States, which has generated taxable income based on intercompany service arrangements. Deferred tax assets benefitted in the United States do not have a valuation allowance against them because of profits that will be generated by an intercompany service agreement. ​ Starting in 2022, amendments to Section 174 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“IRC”), eliminated the option to immediately deduct research and development expenditures in the tax year that such costs are incurred. In accordance with the amendments, beginning on January 1, 2022, and continuing until the end of the second quarter of 2023, these research and development costs were capitalized by the Company and amortized over either a five- or 15-year period, depending on the location of the activities performed. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company completed an assessment, inclusive of an external tax analysis, and concluded that it is not required to capitalize certain research and development expenses incurred by its U.S. subsidiary associated with contractual research services performed on behalf of its U.K. subsidiary pursuant to an intercompany service arrangement because its U.S. subsidiary does not retain any ownership or rights in the underlying intellectual property resulting from the research services. The change in estimate upon the completion of this analysis resulted in the recognition of an income tax provision of $ 2.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company's income tax benefit recognized during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is mainly the result of deferred tax assets benefitted in the U.S. that do not have a valuation allowance against them because of profits that will be generated by an intercompany service agreement. The Company regularly assesses its ability to realize its deferred tax assets. Assessing the realization of deferred tax assets requires significant judgment. In determining whether its deferred tax assets are more likely than not realizable, the Company evaluated all available positive and negative evidence, and weighed the evidence based on its objectivity. After consideration of the evidence, including the Company's history of cumulative net losses in the U.K., the Company has concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefits of its U.K. deferred tax assets and accordingly the Company has provided a valuation allowance for the full amount of the net deferred tax assets in the U.K. The Company has considered its history of cumulative net profits in the United States and estimated future taxable income and has concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of its United States deferred tax assets and has not provided a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets in the United States. The valuation allowance increased in the year ended December 31, 2023 by $ 26.5 million due to the corresponding increase in U.K. deferred tax assets, primarily due to operating loss carryforwards generated during the year that were not surrendered for research credit utilization. The Company recorded a valuation allowance against all of its U.K. deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Company intends to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on its U.K. deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. The release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and an increase to the benefit for income taxes for the period the release is recorded. However, the exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to change on the basis of the level of profitability that the Company is able to actually achieve. The provision for (benefit from) income taxes shown on the consolidated statements of operations differs from amounts that would result from applying the statutory tax rates to income before taxes primarily because of certain permanent expenses that were not deductible and U.K., U.S. federal and state research and development credits, as well as the application of valuation allowances against the U.K. deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $ 266.2 million of U.K. operating loss carryforwards that have an indefinite life. The Company recognizes, in its consolidated financial statements, the effect of a tax position when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination. The Company had no uncertain tax positions during the years ended of December 31, 2023 and 2022. There are no amounts of interest or penalties recognized in the consolidated statement of operations or accrued on the consolidated balance sheet for any period presented. The Company does not expect any material changes in these uncertain tax benefits within the next 12 months. F-45

[1173]: Critical Accounting Estimates
[1174]: Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, costs and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
[1175]: While our significant accounting policies are described in greater detail in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

[1348]: Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm required pursuant to Item 15(a)(2) is submitted under Item 8 of this report.
[1055]: During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2021, the Company received distributions of $ 0.9 million and $ 15.6 million, respectively, from the sales of ownership interests or from the distributions from the sales of the underlying assets of the affiliates, which resulted in no net gains (losses) and a $ 6.9 million net gain, respectively. The Company received no distributions and therefore recognized no net gains (losses) during the year ended December 31, 2022.
[1056]: The Company's ownership interests in its affiliates were as follows:
[1058]: (1) Non-VIE investments.
[1059]: (2) During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company received distributions resulting from the sale of the underlying assets of the affiliate.

[1061]: Table of Contents
[1062]: The following tables present summarized financial information for all of the unconsolidated joint ventures in which the Company holds an investment in affiliate that is accounted for under the equity method of accounting:
[1065]: 9. Other Assets
[1066]: Other assets consisted of the following:
[989]: As presented in Note 20, the Corporate & Other segment revenue amounts were $ 110.9 million, $ 108.9 million, and $ 45.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, which are presented in other revenues and owned hotels revenues in the consolidated statements of income. The remaining revenues relate to the Hotel Franchising & Management reportable segment.
[990]: Royalty, licensing and management fees and other revenues from franchised and managed properties are presented net of intersegment revenues of $ 11.1 million, $ 5.5 million, and $ 2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.

[993]: 3 . Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets
[994]: Prepaid expenses and other current assets consisted of the following:
[996]: 4. Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses
[997]: Notes Receivable
[998]: The Company has provided financing in the form of notes receivable loans to franchisees to support the development of hotel properties in strategic markets. The Company's credit quality indicator is the level of security in the note receivable.
[683]: Results of Operations - Royalty, licensing and management fees, operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share (""EPS"") represent the key measures of our financial performance. These measures are primarily driven by the operations of our hotel franchise system and, therefore, our analysis of the Company's operations is primarily focused on the size, performance, and the potential growth of the hotel franchise system as well as our variable overhead costs.
[684]: Our discussion of our results of operations excludes reimbursable franchise marketing and reservation system revenues and expenses and the management agreement cost reimbursements and expenses included in the Company's other revenues from franchised and managed properties and other expenses from franchised and managed properties. The Company's franchise agreements require the payment of marketing and reservation system fees to be used by the Company for the expenses associated with providing franchise services such as national marketing, media advertising, and central reservation systems. The Company is obligated to expend the marketing and reservation system fees it collects from its franchisees in accordance with the franchise agreements. Furthermore, the franchisees are required to reimburse the Company for any deficits generated by these marketing and reservation system activities. Over time, the Company expects the cumulative revenues and expenses of reimbursable components to break even and, therefore, no income or loss will be generated from the reimbursable marketing and reservation system activities. Additionally, the legacy Radisson Hotels Americas management agreements include cost reimbursements, primarily related to payroll costs at managed hotels where the Company is the employer. As a result, the Company generally excludes the other revenues and other expenses from franchised and managed properties from the analysis of its operations.
[1263]: Pro Forma Results of Operations
[1264]: The following unaudited pro forma information presents the combined results of operations of Choice and Radisson Hotels Americas as if the Transaction was completed on January 1, 2021, but using the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. The unaudited pro forma information reflects adjustments relating to (i) the allocation of the purchase price and related adjustments, including incremental depreciation and amortization expense based on the fair values of the acquired property and equipment and intangible assets, (ii) the incremental impact of the Revolver draw on interest expense and the amortization of financing costs, (iii) nonrecurring transaction costs, and (iv) the income tax impact of the aforementioned pro forma adjustments.

[725]: Table element - Text before table: Other Income (Expense). Other income (expense) was $35 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to no other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2022. Higher interest rates and increased balances in our interest-bearing cash accounts contributed to an increase in interest income. Additionally, higher interest rates and the increase in PDP balances contributed to greater capitalized interest. Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 due to increased rates and balances as compared to the prior period and interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was unfavorably impacted by a $7 million non-cash charge from the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the repayment of the Treasury Loan.
Income Taxes. Our income tax expense was $43 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to an $8 million benefit for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 134.4%, primarily due to a $37 million valuation allowance recorded in December 2023 against our U.S. federal and state net operating loss deferred tax assets, which expire from one year to having no expiration, as a result of being in a three-year cumulative pre-tax loss position and limitations on compensation provided to certain executives pursuant to Internal Revenue Code section 162(m), partially offset by benefits recognized on the exercise of expiring stock options. Please refer to “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—15. Income Taxes” for additional information.

[784]: • $50 million in depreciation and amortization;
[785]: • $43 million in deferred tax expense primarily due to the recognition of a valuation allowance;
[786]: • $14 million in stock-based compensation expense; and
[787]: • $1 million in amortization of cash flow hedges, net of tax.
[788]: During the year ended December 31, 2022, net cash used in operating activities totaled $78 million, which was driven by a $37 million net loss, $14 million of outflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities and non-cash adjustments totaling $27 million.

[920]: Table element - Text before table: We are exposed to interest rate risk through aircraft lease contracts for the time period between agreement of terms and commencement of the lease, where portions of the rental payments are adjusted and become fixed based on swap rates. As part of our risk management program, we enter into contracts in order to limit the exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we did not enter into any swaps and, therefore, paid no upfront premiums for options. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we paid $19 million in upfront premiums for the option to enter into and exercise cash-settled swaps with a forward starting effective date. As of December 31, 2023, we have no interest rate hedges outstanding .

[725]: Table element - Text before table: Other Income (Expense). Other income (expense) was $35 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to no other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2022. Higher interest rates and increased balances in our interest-bearing cash accounts contributed to an increase in interest income. Additionally, higher interest rates and the increase in PDP balances contributed to greater capitalized interest. Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 due to increased rates and balances as compared to the prior period and interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was unfavorably impacted by a $7 million non-cash charge from the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the repayment of the Treasury Loan.
Income Taxes. Our income tax expense was $43 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to an $8 million benefit for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 134.4%, primarily due to a $37 million valuation allowance recorded in December 2023 against our U.S. federal and state net operating loss deferred tax assets, which expire from one year to having no expiration, as a result of being in a three-year cumulative pre-tax loss position and limitations on compensation provided to certain executives pursuant to Internal Revenue Code section 162(m), partially offset by benefits recognized on the exercise of expiring stock options. Please refer to “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—15. Income Taxes” for additional information.

[725]: Table element - Text before table: Other Income (Expense). Other income (expense) was $35 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to no other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2022. Higher interest rates and increased balances in our interest-bearing cash accounts contributed to an increase in interest income. Additionally, higher interest rates and the increase in PDP balances contributed to greater capitalized interest. Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 due to increased rates and balances as compared to the prior period and interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was unfavorably impacted by a $7 million non-cash charge from the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the repayment of the Treasury Loan.
Income Taxes. Our income tax expense was $43 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to an $8 million benefit for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 134.4%, primarily due to a $37 million valuation allowance recorded in December 2023 against our U.S. federal and state net operating loss deferred tax assets, which expire from one year to having no expiration, as a result of being in a three-year cumulative pre-tax loss position and limitations on compensation provided to certain executives pursuant to Internal Revenue Code section 162(m), partially offset by benefits recognized on the exercise of expiring stock options. Please refer to “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—15. Income Taxes” for additional information.

[725]: Table element - Text before table: Other Income (Expense). Other income (expense) was $35 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to no other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2022. Higher interest rates and increased balances in our interest-bearing cash accounts contributed to an increase in interest income. Additionally, higher interest rates and the increase in PDP balances contributed to greater capitalized interest. Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 due to increased rates and balances as compared to the prior period and interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was unfavorably impacted by a $7 million non-cash charge from the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the repayment of the Treasury Loan.
Income Taxes. Our income tax expense was $43 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to an $8 million benefit for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 134.4%, primarily due to a $37 million valuation allowance recorded in December 2023 against our U.S. federal and state net operating loss deferred tax assets, which expire from one year to having no expiration, as a result of being in a three-year cumulative pre-tax loss position and limitations on compensation provided to certain executives pursuant to Internal Revenue Code section 162(m), partially offset by benefits recognized on the exercise of expiring stock options. Please refer to “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—15. Income Taxes” for additional information.

[612]: Inventory
[613]: LNG and natural gas inventory are recorded at the lower of weighted average cost and net realizable value.  Materials and other inventory are recorded at the lower of cost and net realizable value.  Inventory is charged to expense when sold, or, for certain qualifying costs, capitalized to property, plant and equipment when issued, primarily using the weighted average method.
[614]: Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost.  Expenditures for construction and commissioning activities, major renewals and betterments that extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized, while expenditures for maintenance and repairs (including those for planned major maintenance projects) to maintain property, plant and equipment in operating condition are generally expensed as incurred.

[851]: NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
[852]: NOTE 1. BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
[853]: Business —Danaher Corporation (“Danaher” or the “Company”) designs, manufactures and markets professional, medical and industrial products and services, which are typically characterized by strong brand names, innovative technology and major market positions.  As of December 31, 2023, the Company operates in three business segments: • The Biotechnology segment includes the bioprocessing and discovery and medical businesses and offers a broad range of equipment, consumables and services that are primarily used by customers to advance and accelerate the research, development, manufacture and delivery of biological medicines.  The biotherapeutics that the Company’s solutions support range from replacement therapies such as insulin, vaccines, recombinant proteins and other biologic drugs, to novel cell, gene, mRNA and other nucleic acid therapies. • The Life Sciences segment offers a broad range of instruments, consumables, services and software that are primarily used by customers to study genomics and the basic building blocks of life, including DNA and RNA, nucleic acid, proteins, metabolites and cells, in order to understand the causes of disease, identify new therapies, and test and manufacture new drugs, vaccines and gene editing technologies.  Additionally, the segment provides products and consumables used to filter and remove contaminants from a variety of liquids and gases in many end-market applications. • The Diagnostics segment offers clinical instruments, consumables, software and services that hospitals, physicians’ offices, reference laboratories and other critical care settings use to diagnose disease and make treatment decisions. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for a discussion of significant acquisitions and discontinued operations, including the disposal of the Company’s former Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Accounting Principles —The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).  The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.  All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.  The Consolidated Financial Statements also reflect the impact of noncontrolling interests.  Noncontrolling interests do not have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated results of continuing operations, therefore earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests for continuing operations are not presented separately in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests have been reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses and were insignificant in all periods presented.  Reclassifications of certain prior year amounts have been made to conform to the current year presentation. Use of Estimates —The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  The Company bases these estimates on historical experience, the current economic environment and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.  However, uncertainties associated with these estimates exist and actual results may differ materially from these estimates. Cash and Equivalents —The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Accounts Receivable and Allowances for Doubtful Accounts —All trade accounts, contract and finance receivables are reported on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets adjusted for any write-offs and net of allowances for doubtful accounts.  The allowances for doubtful accounts represent management’s best estimate of the expected future credit losses from the Company’s trade accounts, contract and finance receivable portfolios.  Determination of the allowances requires management to exercise judgment about the timing, frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the provision for credit losses and, therefore, net earnings.  The Company regularly performs detailed reviews of its portfolios to determine if an impairment has occurred and evaluates the collectability of receivables based on a combination of various financial and qualitative factors that may affect customers’ ability to pay, including customers’ financial condition, collateral, debt-servicing ability, past payment experience and credit bureau information.  In circumstances where the Company is aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations, a specific reserve is recorded against amounts due to reduce the recognized receivable to the amount reasonably expected to be collected.  Additions to the allowances for doubtful accounts are charged to current period earnings, amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged directly against the allowances, while amounts recovered on previously written-off accounts increase the allowances.  If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional reserves would be required.  The Company does not believe that trade accounts receivable represents significant concentrations of credit risk because of the diversified portfolio of
[931]: NOTE 6. SEGMENT INFORMATION
[932]: In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company realigned its reportable segments to reflect changes in the Company’s internal organization resulting from the rate of growth within certain of the Company’s businesses in the former Life Sciences segment.  There was no change to the Company’s Diagnostics segment.  Prior period segment amounts have been restated to conform to the revised segment presentation.
[933]: The Company operates and reports its results in three separate business segments consisting of the Biotechnology, Life Sciences and Diagnostics segments.  Operating profit represents total revenues less"

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the derivative instrument is marked to market, with gains and losses recognized currently in income to offset the respective losses and gains recognized on the underlying exposure. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (see Note 17) and reclassified into earnings in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings. For derivative and non-derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as net investment hedges, the foreign currency translation gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (see Note 17). Derivative contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments are recorded at fair value with the gain or loss recognized in earnings during the period of change.
We may enter into foreign currency forward or option contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates (primarily the euro, Chinese yuan, and Japanese yen). Foreign currency derivatives used for hedging are put in place using the same or like currencies and duration as the underlying exposures. Forward and option contracts are principally used to manage exposures arising from subsidiary trade and loan payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies. These contracts are recorded at fair value with the gain or loss recognized in other–net, (income) expense. Forward contracts generally have maturities not exceeding 12 months.

[597]: Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Implementation of New Financial Accounting Standards
[598]: Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include Eli Lilly and Company and all subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). We consider majority voting interests, as well as effective economic or other control over an entity when deciding whether or not to consolidate an entity. We generally do not have control by means other than voting interests. Where our ownership of consolidated subsidiaries is less than 100 percent, the noncontrolling shareholders' interests are reflected as a separate component of equity. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We issued our financial statements by filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and have evaluated subsequent events up to the time of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We operate as a single operating segment engaged in the discovery, development, manufacturing, marketing, and sales of pharmaceutical products worldwide. A global research and development organization and a supply chain organization are responsible for the discovery, development, manufacturing, and supply of our products. Regional commercial organizations market, distribute, and sell the products. The business is also supported by global corporate staff functions. Our determination that we operate as a single segment is consistent with the financial information regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker for purposes of evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets, and planning and forecasting for future periods. Research and Development Expenses and Acquired In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D) Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs consist of expenses incurred in performing research and development activities, including but not limited to, compensation and benefits, facilities and overhead expense, clinical trial expense and fees paid to contract research organizations. Acquired IPR&D includes the initial costs and development milestones incurred related to externally developed IPR&D projects, acquired directly in a transaction other than a business combination, that do not have an alternative future use. Development milestones are milestone payment obligations that are incurred prior to regulatory approval of the compound and are expensed when the event triggering an obligation to pay the milestone occurs. Earnings Per Share (EPS) All per-share amounts, unless otherwise noted in the footnotes, are presented on a diluted basis. We calculate basic EPS based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus the effect of incremental shares from potential participating securities. We calculate diluted EPS based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus the effect of incremental shares from our stock-based compensation programs.

[968]: Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
[969]: To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Eli Lilly and Company
[970]: Opinion on the Financial Statements
[971]: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Eli Lilly and Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ""consolidated financial statements""). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
[972]: We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 21, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
[601]: Note 2: Revenue
[602]: The following table summarizes our revenue recognized in our consolidated statements of operations:
[604]: (1) Collaboration and other revenue associated with prior period transfers of intellectual property was $ 191.6 million, $ 163.4 million, and $ 175.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.
[605]: 63
[606]: We recognize revenue primarily from two different types of contracts, product sales to customers (net product revenue) and collaborations and other arrangements. Revenue recognized from collaborations and other arrangements includes our share of profits from the collaborations, as well as royalties, upfront and milestone payments we receive under these types of contracts. See Note 4 for additional information related to our collaborations and other arrangements. Collaboration and other revenue disclosed above includes the revenue from the Jardiance ® and Trajenta ® families of products resulting from our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, as well as from the sales of rights for the olanzapine portfolio, including Zyprexa ® , and for Baqsimi ® , all of which are discussed in Note 4. Substantially all of the remainder of collaboration and other revenue is related to contracts accounted for as contracts with customers. Net Product Revenue Revenue from sales of products is recognized at the point where the customer obtains control of the goods and we satisfy our performance obligation, which generally is at the time we ship the product to the customer. Payment terms differ by jurisdiction and customer, but payment terms in most of our major jurisdictions typically range from 30 to 70 days from date of shipment. Revenue for our product sales has not been adjusted for the effects of a financing component as we expect, at contract inception, that the period between when we transfer control of the product and when we receive payment will be one year or less. Any exceptions are either not material or we collect interest for payments made after the due date. Provisions for rebates, discounts, and returns are established in the same period the related product sales are recognized. We generally ship product shortly after orders are received; therefore, we generally only have a few days of orders received but not yet shipped at the end of any reporting period. Shipping and handling activities are considered to be fulfillment activities and are not considered to be a separate performance obligation. We exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are imposed on our sales of product and collected from a customer. Most of our products are sold to wholesalers that serve pharmacies, physicians and other healthcare professionals, and hospitals. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, our three largest wholesalers each accounted for between 16 percent and 21 percent of consolidated revenue. Further, they each accounted for between 18 percent and 29 percent of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Significant judgments must be made in determining the transaction price for our sales of products related to anticipated rebates, discounts, and returns. The following describe the most significant of these judgments: Sales Rebates and Discounts - Background and Uncertainties • We initially invoice our customers at contractual list prices. Contracts with direct and indirect customers may provide for various rebates and discounts that may differ in each contract. As a consequence, to determine the appropriate transaction price for our product sales at the time we recognize a sale to a direct customer, we estimate any rebates or discounts that ultimately will be due to the direct customer and other customers in the distribution chain under the terms of our contracts. Significant judgments are required in making these estimates. • The rebate and discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net product revenue. Sales rebates and discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, chargebacks, long-term care, hospital, patient assistance programs, and various other programs. We estimate these accruals using an expected value approach. • The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts include rebates associated with sales covered by managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, and chargeback programs, as well as reductions in revenue related to our patient assistance programs, in the U.S. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical rebate payments for these programs, as well as patient assistance program costs, by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends (e.g., patent expiries and product launches), an evaluation of the current contracts for these programs, the percentage of our products that are sold via these programs, and our product pricing. Although we accrue a liability for revenue reductions related to these programs at the time we record the sale, the reduction related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later. Because of this time lag, in any particular period our net product revenue may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods.

As of December 31, 2023, we do not intend to sell, and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell, the securities in a loss position before the market values recover or the underlying cash flows have been received, and there is no indication of a material default on interest or principal payments for our debt securities.

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the derivative instrument is marked to market, with gains and losses recognized currently in income to offset the respective losses and gains recognized on the underlying exposure. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (see Note 17) and reclassified into earnings in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings. For derivative and non-derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as net investment hedges, the foreign currency translation gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (see Note 17). Derivative contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments are recorded at fair value with the gain or loss recognized in earnings during the period of change.
We may enter into foreign currency forward or option contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates (primarily the euro, Chinese yuan, and Japanese yen). Foreign currency derivatives used for hedging are put in place using the same or like currencies and duration as the underlying exposures. Forward and option contracts are principally used to manage exposures arising from subsidiary trade and loan payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies. These contracts are recorded at fair value with the gain or loss recognized in other–net, (income) expense. Forward contracts generally have maturities not exceeding 12 months. At December 31, 2023, we had outstanding foreign currency forward commitments as follows, all of which have settlement dates within 180 days:; table: (row 0)

[603]: Table element - Text before table: Foreign Currency Translation Operations in our subsidiaries outside the United States (U.S.) are recorded in the functional currency of each subsidiary which is determined by a review of the environment where each subsidiary primarily generates and expends cash. The results of operations for our subsidiaries outside the U.S. are translated from functional currencies into U.S. dollars using the weighted-average currency rate for the period. Assets and liabilities are translated using the period end exchange rates. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from translating the net assets of these subsidiaries are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). Advertising Expenses Costs associated with advertising are expensed as incurred and are included in marketing, selling, and administrative expenses. Advertising expenses, comprised primarily of online marketing and television advertising, totaled $ 1.12 billion, $ 966.8 million, and $ 1.24 billion in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, which was less than 5 percent of revenue each year. Other Significant Accounting Policies Our other significant accounting policies are described in the remaining appropriate notes to the consolidated financial statements. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to conform with the current presentation. Development milestone payments related to externally developed IPR&D projects, acquired directly in a transaction other than a business combination, were previously included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows and are now included in purchases of IPR&D in cash flows from investing activities. The reclassification resulted in an increase to net cash provided by operating activities and net cash used in investing activities of $ 501.3 million and $ 105.2 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Implementation of New Financial Accounting Standards Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures , establishes incremental disaggregation of income tax disclosures pertaining to the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and requires prospective application with the option to apply it retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We intend to adopt this standard in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2025. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this standard on our disclosures. ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, requires disclosures about significant segment expenses and additional interim disclosure requirements. This standard also requires a single reportable segment to provide all disclosures required by ASC 280. This standard is effective for fiscal"

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the derivative instrument is marked to market, with gains and losses recognized currently in income to offset the respective losses and gains recognized on the underlying exposure. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (see Note 17) and reclassified into earnings in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings. For derivative and non-derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as net investment hedges, the foreign currency translation gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (see Note 17). Derivative contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments are recorded at fair value with the gain or loss recognized in earnings during the period of change.
We may enter into foreign currency forward or option contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates (primarily the euro, Chinese yuan, and Japanese yen). Foreign currency derivatives used for hedging are put in place using the same or like currencies and duration as the underlying exposures. Forward and option contracts are principally used to manage exposures arising from subsidiary trade and loan payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies. These contracts are recorded at fair value with the gain or loss recognized in other–net, (income) expense. Forward contracts generally have maturities not exceeding 12 months.

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the derivative instrument is marked to market, with gains and losses recognized currently in income to offset the respective losses and gains recognized on the underlying exposure. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (see Note 17) and reclassified into earnings in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings. For derivative and non-derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as net investment hedges, the foreign currency translation gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (see Note 17). Derivative contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments are recorded at fair value with the gain or loss recognized in earnings during the period of change.
We may enter into foreign currency forward or option contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates (primarily the euro, Chinese yuan, and Japanese yen). Foreign currency derivatives used for hedging are put in place using the same or like currencies and duration as the underlying exposures. Forward and option contracts are principally used to manage exposures arising from subsidiary trade and loan payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies. These contracts are recorded at fair value with the gain or loss recognized in other–net, (income) expense. Forward contracts generally have maturities not exceeding 12 months.

[940]: * Amount related to the respective customer represented less than 10% for the period presented.
[941]: Valuation of Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, determined by the first-in, first-out method. Inventory is recorded using standard cost, including material, labor and overhead costs. The Company periodically reviews inventories for potential impairment and adjusts inventory for potentially excess or obsolete goods to state inventories at their net realizable value. Factors influencing these adjustments include quantities on hand and firm purchase commitments, expectations of future use, judgments based on quality control testing data and assessments of the likelihood of scrapping or obsoleting certain inventories based on future demand for its products and market conditions.
[838]: Critical Accounting Policies Involving Management Estimates and Assumptions
[839]: Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about our financial condition and results of operations that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.
[1131]: Table element - Text before table: Purchase Obligations The Company has agreements with suppliers and other parties to purchase inventory, other goods and services and long-lived assets. Product inventory obligations consist primarily of purchase order commitments for raw materials used in the production of insulin pumps and cartridges, and finished goods infusion sets. Cancellation of outstanding purchase orders is generally allowed under the standard terms of our purchase order agreements, but may require payment of costs incurred through the date of cancellation. At December 31, 2023, obligations under our purchase agreements totaled approximately $ 189.2 million, of which approximately $ 181.5 million is scheduled to be received and become payable within one-year.

[718]: General. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Refer to Note 1, “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our consolidated financial statements for further information on our significant accounting policies.
[719]: 49
[720]: We evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenues, goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes and contingencies, on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on current facts and circumstances, historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable, which form the basis for making judgments about the values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

[1000]: The table below presents revenues and Adjusted Segment EBITDA for our reportable segments:
[1003]: (1) Effective July 1, 2023, prior period segment information for the Corporate Finance and FLC segments has been recast in this Annual Report to include the reclassification of the portion of the Company’s health solutions practice in the FLC segment to our realigned business transformation practice within our Corporate Finance segment.
[1004]: The table below reconciles net income to Total Adjusted Segment EBITDA. Unallocated corporate expenses primarily include indirect costs related to centrally managed administrative functions that have not been allocated to the segments. These administrative costs include costs related to executive management, legal, corporate office support costs, information technology, accounting, marketing, human resources and company-wide business development and strategy functions.
[1006]: 84
[1007]: The table below presents assets by reportable segment, reconciled to consolidated amounts. Segment assets primarily include accounts and notes receivable, fixed assets purchased specifically for the segment, goodwill and intangible assets.

[1503]: Table element - Text before table: On October 9, 2023, the SED submitted for adoption by the CPUC a draft resolution approving an Administrative Consent Order and Agreement between the SED and the Utility (the “Dixie ACO”).  The Dixie ACO would resolve the SED’s investigation into the 2021 Dixie fire.  The Dixie ACO provides that the Utility would (i) pay $ 2.5 million to California’s General Fund; (ii) pay $ 2.5 million to tribes impacted by the 2021 Dixie fire; (iii) and undertake an initiative to transition to electronic records for specified patrols and inspections of distribution facilities, at an approximate cost of $ 40 million over five years , and the Utility may not seek recovery of such costs.  The SED agreed to refrain from instituting any further enforcement proceedings against the Utility related to the 2021 Dixie fire.  The Dixie ACO states that it does not constitute an admission or evidence of any wrongdoing, fault, omission, negligence, imprudence, or liability on the part of the Utility.  The Dixie ACO also states that the parties to it intend that it shall not affect whether the Utility may obtain recovery of costs and expenses incurred in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire, including for amounts drawn from the Wildfire Fund or otherwise sought through a cost recovery application to the CPUC.  On February 2, 2024, the CPUC issued a final decision approving the Dixie ACO.  In connection with the Dixie ACO, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded a liability of $ 5 million reflected in Other current liabilities on the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2023.  For the recordkeeping initiative costs for which the Utility will not seek recovery, the Utility expects to record disallowances as such costs are incurred. As of February 14, 2024, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are aware of approximately 161 complaints on behalf of at least 8,387 individual plaintiffs and a separate putative class complaint related to the 2021 Dixie fire and expect that they may receive further complaints.  The plaintiffs seek damages that include wrongful death, property damage, economic loss, medical monitoring, punitive damages, exemplary damages, attorneys’ fees and other damages.  On September 20, 2023, the court vacated the November 8, 2023 trial date and scheduled a new trial date for April 2, 2024.  On June 30, 2023, Cal Fire also filed a complaint largely repeating the allegations of the earlier Cal Fire Investigation Report and seeking damages for fire suppression and investigation costs. On January 17, 2023, PG&E Corporation and the Utility reached an agreement with certain public entities to settle their claims for $ 24 million. On March 2, 2023, PG&E Corporation and the Utility entered into an agreement with the insurance subrogation plaintiffs in the 2021 Dixie fire litigation to resolve their claims arising from the 2021 Dixie fire. Based on the current state of the law concerning inverse condemnation in California and the facts and circumstances available to PG&E Corporation and the Utility as of the date of this filing, including Cal Fire’s determination of the cause and the information gathered as part of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s investigation, PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe it is probable that they will incur a loss in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded a liability in the aggregate amount of $ 1.175 billion as of December 31, 2022 (before available recoveries).  Based on the facts and circumstances available to PG&E Corporation and the Utility as of the date of this filing, including their experience to date in settling the claims of individual plaintiffs, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded an additional charge in the third quarter of 2023 for probable losses in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire of $ 425 million for an aggregate liability of $ 1.6 billion (before available insurance) as of December 31, 2023. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s accrued estimated losses of $ 1.6 billion do not include, among other things: (i) any amounts for potential penalties or fines that may be imposed by courts or other governmental entities on PG&E Corporation or the Utility, (ii) any punitive damages, (iii) any amounts in respect of compensation claims by federal or state agencies including for state or federal fire suppression costs and damages related to federal land, (iv) medical monitoring costs, or (v) any other amounts that are not reasonably estimable. As noted above, the aggregate estimated liability for claims in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire does not include potential claims for fire suppression costs from federal, state, county, or local agencies or damage to land and vegetation in national parks or national forests.  As to these damages, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have not concluded that a loss is probable.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to reasonably estimate the range of possible losses for any such claims due to, among other factors, incomplete information as to facts pertinent to potential claims and defenses, as well as facts that would bear on the amount, type, and valuation of vegetation loss, potential reforestation, habitat loss, and other resources damaged or destroyed by the 2021 Dixie fire.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe, however, that such losses could be significant with respect to fire suppression costs due to the size and duration of the 2021 Dixie fire and corresponding magnitude of fire suppression resources dedicated to fighting the 2021 Dixie fire and with respect to claims for damage to land and vegetation in national parks or national forests due to the very large number of acres of national parks and national forests that were affected by the 2021 Dixie fire.  According to the Cal Fire Investigation Report, over $ 650 million of costs had been incurred in suppressing the 2021 Dixie fire.  The Utility estimates that the fire burned approximately 70,000 acres of national parks and approximately 685,000 acres of national forests.

[1503]: Table element - Text before table: On October 9, 2023, the SED submitted for adoption by the CPUC a draft resolution approving an Administrative Consent Order and Agreement between the SED and the Utility (the “Dixie ACO”).  The Dixie ACO would resolve the SED’s investigation into the 2021 Dixie fire.  The Dixie ACO provides that the Utility would (i) pay $ 2.5 million to California’s General Fund; (ii) pay $ 2.5 million to tribes impacted by the 2021 Dixie fire; (iii) and undertake an initiative to transition to electronic records for specified patrols and inspections of distribution facilities, at an approximate cost of $ 40 million over five years , and the Utility may not seek recovery of such costs.  The SED agreed to refrain from instituting any further enforcement proceedings against the Utility related to the 2021 Dixie fire.  The Dixie ACO states that it does not constitute an admission or evidence of any wrongdoing, fault, omission, negligence, imprudence, or liability on the part of the Utility.  The Dixie ACO also states that the parties to it intend that it shall not affect whether the Utility may obtain recovery of costs and expenses incurred in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire, including for amounts drawn from the Wildfire Fund or otherwise sought through a cost recovery application to the CPUC.  On February 2, 2024, the CPUC issued a final decision approving the Dixie ACO.  In connection with the Dixie ACO, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded a liability of $ 5 million reflected in Other current liabilities on the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2023.  For the recordkeeping initiative costs for which the Utility will not seek recovery, the Utility expects to record disallowances as such costs are incurred. As of February 14, 2024, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are aware of approximately 161 complaints on behalf of at least 8,387 individual plaintiffs and a separate putative class complaint related to the 2021 Dixie fire and expect that they may receive further complaints.  The plaintiffs seek damages that include wrongful death, property damage, economic loss, medical monitoring, punitive damages, exemplary damages, attorneys’ fees and other damages.  On September 20, 2023, the court vacated the November 8, 2023 trial date and scheduled a new trial date for April 2, 2024.  On June 30, 2023, Cal Fire also filed a complaint largely repeating the allegations of the earlier Cal Fire Investigation Report and seeking damages for fire suppression and investigation costs. On January 17, 2023, PG&E Corporation and the Utility reached an agreement with certain public entities to settle their claims for $ 24 million. On March 2, 2023, PG&E Corporation and the Utility entered into an agreement with the insurance subrogation plaintiffs in the 2021 Dixie fire litigation to resolve their claims arising from the 2021 Dixie fire. Based on the current state of the law concerning inverse condemnation in California and the facts and circumstances available to PG&E Corporation and the Utility as of the date of this filing, including Cal Fire’s determination of the cause and the information gathered as part of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s investigation, PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe it is probable that they will incur a loss in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded a liability in the aggregate amount of $ 1.175 billion as of December 31, 2022 (before available recoveries).  Based on the facts and circumstances available to PG&E Corporation and the Utility as of the date of this filing, including their experience to date in settling the claims of individual plaintiffs, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded an additional charge in the third quarter of 2023 for probable losses in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire of $ 425 million for an aggregate liability of $ 1.6 billion (before available insurance) as of December 31, 2023. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s accrued estimated losses of $ 1.6 billion do not include, among other things: (i) any amounts for potential penalties or fines that may be imposed by courts or other governmental entities on PG&E Corporation or the Utility, (ii) any punitive damages, (iii) any amounts in respect of compensation claims by federal or state agencies including for state or federal fire suppression costs and damages related to federal land, (iv) medical monitoring costs, or (v) any other amounts that are not reasonably estimable. As noted above, the aggregate estimated liability for claims in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire does not include potential claims for fire suppression costs from federal, state, county, or local agencies or damage to land and vegetation in national parks or national forests.  As to these damages, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have not concluded that a loss is probable.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to reasonably estimate the range of possible losses for any such claims due to, among other factors, incomplete information as to facts pertinent to potential claims and defenses, as well as facts that would bear on the amount, type, and valuation of vegetation loss, potential reforestation, habitat loss, and other resources damaged or destroyed by the 2021 Dixie fire.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe, however, that such losses could be significant with respect to fire suppression costs due to the size and duration of the 2021 Dixie fire and corresponding magnitude of fire suppression resources dedicated to fighting the 2021 Dixie fire and with respect to claims for damage to land and vegetation in national parks or national forests due to the very large number of acres of national parks and national forests that were affected by the 2021 Dixie fire.  According to the Cal Fire Investigation Report, over $ 650 million of costs had been incurred in suppressing the 2021 Dixie fire.  The Utility estimates that the fire burned approximately 70,000 acres of national parks and approximately 685,000 acres of national forests.

[1503]: Table element - Text before table: On October 9, 2023, the SED submitted for adoption by the CPUC a draft resolution approving an Administrative Consent Order and Agreement between the SED and the Utility (the “Dixie ACO”).  The Dixie ACO would resolve the SED’s investigation into the 2021 Dixie fire.  The Dixie ACO provides that the Utility would (i) pay $ 2.5 million to California’s General Fund; (ii) pay $ 2.5 million to tribes impacted by the 2021 Dixie fire; (iii) and undertake an initiative to transition to electronic records for specified patrols and inspections of distribution facilities, at an approximate cost of $ 40 million over five years , and the Utility may not seek recovery of such costs.  The SED agreed to refrain from instituting any further enforcement proceedings against the Utility related to the 2021 Dixie fire.  The Dixie ACO states that it does not constitute an admission or evidence of any wrongdoing, fault, omission, negligence, imprudence, or liability on the part of the Utility.  The Dixie ACO also states that the parties to it intend that it shall not affect whether the Utility may obtain recovery of costs and expenses incurred in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire, including for amounts drawn from the Wildfire Fund or otherwise sought through a cost recovery application to the CPUC.  On February 2, 2024, the CPUC issued a final decision approving the Dixie ACO.  In connection with the Dixie ACO, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded a liability of $ 5 million reflected in Other current liabilities on the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2023.  For the recordkeeping initiative costs for which the Utility will not seek recovery, the Utility expects to record disallowances as such costs are incurred. As of February 14, 2024, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are aware of approximately 161 complaints on behalf of at least 8,387 individual plaintiffs and a separate putative class complaint related to the 2021 Dixie fire and expect that they may receive further complaints.  The plaintiffs seek damages that include wrongful death, property damage, economic loss, medical monitoring, punitive damages, exemplary damages, attorneys’ fees and other damages.  On September 20, 2023, the court vacated the November 8, 2023 trial date and scheduled a new trial date for April 2, 2024.  On June 30, 2023, Cal Fire also filed a complaint largely repeating the allegations of the earlier Cal Fire Investigation Report and seeking damages for fire suppression and investigation costs. On January 17, 2023, PG&E Corporation and the Utility reached an agreement with certain public entities to settle their claims for $ 24 million. On March 2, 2023, PG&E Corporation and the Utility entered into an agreement with the insurance subrogation plaintiffs in the 2021 Dixie fire litigation to resolve their claims arising from the 2021 Dixie fire. Based on the current state of the law concerning inverse condemnation in California and the facts and circumstances available to PG&E Corporation and the Utility as of the date of this filing, including Cal Fire’s determination of the cause and the information gathered as part of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s investigation, PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe it is probable that they will incur a loss in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded a liability in the aggregate amount of $ 1.175 billion as of December 31, 2022 (before available recoveries).  Based on the facts and circumstances available to PG&E Corporation and the Utility as of the date of this filing, including their experience to date in settling the claims of individual plaintiffs, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded an additional charge in the third quarter of 2023 for probable losses in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire of $ 425 million for an aggregate liability of $ 1.6 billion (before available insurance) as of December 31, 2023. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s accrued estimated losses of $ 1.6 billion do not include, among other things: (i) any amounts for potential penalties or fines that may be imposed by courts or other governmental entities on PG&E Corporation or the Utility, (ii) any punitive damages, (iii) any amounts in respect of compensation claims by federal or state agencies including for state or federal fire suppression costs and damages related to federal land, (iv) medical monitoring costs, or (v) any other amounts that are not reasonably estimable. As noted above, the aggregate estimated liability for claims in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire does not include potential claims for fire suppression costs from federal, state, county, or local agencies or damage to land and vegetation in national parks or national forests.  As to these damages, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have not concluded that a loss is probable.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to reasonably estimate the range of possible losses for any such claims due to, among other factors, incomplete information as to facts pertinent to potential claims and defenses, as well as facts that would bear on the amount, type, and valuation of vegetation loss, potential reforestation, habitat loss, and other resources damaged or destroyed by the 2021 Dixie fire.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe, however, that such losses could be significant with respect to fire suppression costs due to the size and duration of the 2021 Dixie fire and corresponding magnitude of fire suppression resources dedicated to fighting the 2021 Dixie fire and with respect to claims for damage to land and vegetation in national parks or national forests due to the very large number of acres of national parks and national forests that were affected by the 2021 Dixie fire.  According to the Cal Fire Investigation Report, over $ 650 million of costs had been incurred in suppressing the 2021 Dixie fire.  The Utility estimates that the fire burned approximately 70,000 acres of national parks and approximately 685,000 acres of national forests.

[1503]: Table element - Text before table: On October 9, 2023, the SED submitted for adoption by the CPUC a draft resolution approving an Administrative Consent Order and Agreement between the SED and the Utility (the “Dixie ACO”).  The Dixie ACO would resolve the SED’s investigation into the 2021 Dixie fire.  The Dixie ACO provides that the Utility would (i) pay $ 2.5 million to California’s General Fund; (ii) pay $ 2.5 million to tribes impacted by the 2021 Dixie fire; (iii) and undertake an initiative to transition to electronic records for specified patrols and inspections of distribution facilities, at an approximate cost of $ 40 million over five years , and the Utility may not seek recovery of such costs.  The SED agreed to refrain from instituting any further enforcement proceedings against the Utility related to the 2021 Dixie fire.  The Dixie ACO states that it does not constitute an admission or evidence of any wrongdoing, fault, omission, negligence, imprudence, or liability on the part of the Utility.  The Dixie ACO also states that the parties to it intend that it shall not affect whether the Utility may obtain recovery of costs and expenses incurred in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire, including for amounts drawn from the Wildfire Fund or otherwise sought through a cost recovery application to the CPUC.  On February 2, 2024, the CPUC issued a final decision approving the Dixie ACO.  In connection with the Dixie ACO, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded a liability of $ 5 million reflected in Other current liabilities on the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2023.  For the recordkeeping initiative costs for which the Utility will not seek recovery, the Utility expects to record disallowances as such costs are incurred. As of February 14, 2024, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are aware of approximately 161 complaints on behalf of at least 8,387 individual plaintiffs and a separate putative class complaint related to the 2021 Dixie fire and expect that they may receive further complaints.  The plaintiffs seek damages that include wrongful death, property damage, economic loss, medical monitoring, punitive damages, exemplary damages, attorneys’ fees and other damages.  On September 20, 2023, the court vacated the November 8, 2023 trial date and scheduled a new trial date for April 2, 2024.  On June 30, 2023, Cal Fire also filed a complaint largely repeating the allegations of the earlier Cal Fire Investigation Report and seeking damages for fire suppression and investigation costs. On January 17, 2023, PG&E Corporation and the Utility reached an agreement with certain public entities to settle their claims for $ 24 million. On March 2, 2023, PG&E Corporation and the Utility entered into an agreement with the insurance subrogation plaintiffs in the 2021 Dixie fire litigation to resolve their claims arising from the 2021 Dixie fire. Based on the current state of the law concerning inverse condemnation in California and the facts and circumstances available to PG&E Corporation and the Utility as of the date of this filing, including Cal Fire’s determination of the cause and the information gathered as part of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s investigation, PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe it is probable that they will incur a loss in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded a liability in the aggregate amount of $ 1.175 billion as of December 31, 2022 (before available recoveries).  Based on the facts and circumstances available to PG&E Corporation and the Utility as of the date of this filing, including their experience to date in settling the claims of individual plaintiffs, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded an additional charge in the third quarter of 2023 for probable losses in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire of $ 425 million for an aggregate liability of $ 1.6 billion (before available insurance) as of December 31, 2023. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s accrued estimated losses of $ 1.6 billion do not include, among other things: (i) any amounts for potential penalties or fines that may be imposed by courts or other governmental entities on PG&E Corporation or the Utility, (ii) any punitive damages, (iii) any amounts in respect of compensation claims by federal or state agencies including for state or federal fire suppression costs and damages related to federal land, (iv) medical monitoring costs, or (v) any other amounts that are not reasonably estimable. As noted above, the aggregate estimated liability for claims in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire does not include potential claims for fire suppression costs from federal, state, county, or local agencies or damage to land and vegetation in national parks or national forests.  As to these damages, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have not concluded that a loss is probable.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to reasonably estimate the range of possible losses for any such claims due to, among other factors, incomplete information as to facts pertinent to potential claims and defenses, as well as facts that would bear on the amount, type, and valuation of vegetation loss, potential reforestation, habitat loss, and other resources damaged or destroyed by the 2021 Dixie fire.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe, however, that such losses could be significant with respect to fire suppression costs due to the size and duration of the 2021 Dixie fire and corresponding magnitude of fire suppression resources dedicated to fighting the 2021 Dixie fire and with respect to claims for damage to land and vegetation in national parks or national forests due to the very large number of acres of national parks and national forests that were affected by the 2021 Dixie fire.  According to the Cal Fire Investigation Report, over $ 650 million of costs had been incurred in suppressing the 2021 Dixie fire.  The Utility estimates that the fire burned approximately 70,000 acres of national parks and approximately 685,000 acres of national forests.

[517]: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in the section titled “Part II, Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, equity, revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, accounting for income taxes and stock-based compensation.

[714]: Opinion on the financial statements
[715]: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Qualys, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
[687]: Critical Accounting Estimates
[688]: The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 - The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based on historical and anticipated results and trends that we believe represent our best estimate under the circumstances. However, as accounting estimates are subject to inherent uncertainty, our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
[689]: Income Taxes
[690]: Significant assumptions, judgments and estimates are involved in determining our provision for (benefit from) income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our deferred tax assets. Our judgments, assumptions and estimates relating to the current provision for income taxes include the geographic mix and amount of income (loss), expectations of future income, our interpretation of current tax laws, our business, and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. Our judgments also include anticipating the tax positions we will record in the financial statements before preparing and filing the tax returns. Our estimates and assumptions may differ from the actual results as reflected in our income tax returns and we record the required adjustments when they are identified or resolved. Changes in our business and tax laws or our interpretation of those, and developments in current and future tax audits, could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

[800]: Table of Contents
[801]: Comprehensive Income (Loss) Other comprehensive income (loss) consists of unrealized gains (losses) on marketable securities, net of tax, and derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges, net of tax, which are not included in the Company’s net income. Total comprehensive income includes net income and other comprehensive income (loss) and is included in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Foreign Currency Transactions The Company’s operations are conducted in various countries around the world and the financial statements of its foreign subsidiaries are reported in the U.S. dollar as their respective functional currency. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies have been re-measured into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and income and expenses are re-measured at average exchange rates during the period. Foreign currency re-measurement gains and losses and foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net. Net Income Per Share Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding plus potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period. The potentially dilutive shares are computed by applying the treasury stock method to the Company's stock options, RSUs and the stock purchase rights under the ESPP. Any potential shares that would be anti-dilutive are excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements None. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") 2023-07 requiring enhanced segment disclosures. The ASU requires disclosure of significant segment expenses regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (""CODM"") included within segment operating profit or loss. Additionally, the ASU requires a description of how the CODM utilizes segment operating profit or loss to assess segment performance. The requirements of the ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company's annual reporting requirements will be effective for fiscal 2024 and interim reporting requirements will be effective beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Early adoption is permitted and retrospective application is required for all periods presented. The Company is in the process of analyzing the impact of the ASU on related disclosures. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 requiring enhanced income tax disclosures. The ASU requires disclosure of specific categories and disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation table. The ASU also requires disclosure of disaggregated information related to income taxes paid, income or loss from continuing operations before income tax expense or benefit, and income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations. The requirements of the ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and the amendments should be applied on a prospective basis. Retrospective application is permitted. The Company is in the process of analyzing the impact of the ASU on related disclosures. The Company does not believe any other new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB that have not become effective will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

[615]: Table element - Text before table: We are subject to federal, state and foreign income taxes for jurisdictions in which we operate, and we use estimates in determining our income tax provision and deferred tax assets. Earnings from our non-U.S. activities are subject to income taxes in the local countries at rates which are generally similar to the U.S. statutory tax rate. We regularly assess the realizability of our net deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2023, valuation allowances remain in certain jurisdictions where we believe it is necessary to see further positive evidence, such as sustained achievement of sufficient profits to meet a more likely than not stance that the valuation allowance should be reversed. If additional positive evidence becomes available in the foreseeable future, we may release all or a portion of the valuation allowance. The exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release is subject to change based on the level of profitability achieved in future periods. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and a corresponding decrease to income tax expense in the period the release is recorded.

Under ASC 280 Segment Reporting, operating segments are defined as components of an entity about which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company operates in one segment and has only one reportable segment. The Company’s chief operating decision maker is the Chief Executive Officer, who makes operating decisions, assesses performance and allocates resources on a consolidated basis. All of the Company’s principal operations and decision-making functions are located in the United States.

[615]: Table element - Text before table: We are subject to federal, state and foreign income taxes for jurisdictions in which we operate, and we use estimates in determining our income tax provision and deferred tax assets. Earnings from our non-U.S. activities are subject to income taxes in the local countries at rates which are generally similar to the U.S. statutory tax rate. We regularly assess the realizability of our net deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2023, valuation allowances remain in certain jurisdictions where we believe it is necessary to see further positive evidence, such as sustained achievement of sufficient profits to meet a more likely than not stance that the valuation allowance should be reversed. If additional positive evidence becomes available in the foreseeable future, we may release all or a portion of the valuation allowance. The exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release is subject to change based on the level of profitability achieved in future periods. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and a corresponding decrease to income tax expense in the period the release is recorded.

[615]: Table element - Text before table: We are subject to federal, state and foreign income taxes for jurisdictions in which we operate, and we use estimates in determining our income tax provision and deferred tax assets. Earnings from our non-U.S. activities are subject to income taxes in the local countries at rates which are generally similar to the U.S. statutory tax rate. We regularly assess the realizability of our net deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2023, valuation allowances remain in certain jurisdictions where we believe it is necessary to see further positive evidence, such as sustained achievement of sufficient profits to meet a more likely than not stance that the valuation allowance should be reversed. If additional positive evidence becomes available in the foreseeable future, we may release all or a portion of the valuation allowance. The exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release is subject to change based on the level of profitability achieved in future periods. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and a corresponding decrease to income tax expense in the period the release is recorded.

[335]: Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $6,177.8 as compared to $5,371.8 for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of 15.0%. The components of revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2023 were as follows:
[337]: In our Application Software segment, net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $3,186.9 as compared to $2,639.5 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The growth of 5.9% in organic revenues was broad-based across the segment led by our businesses serving the government contracting, property and casualty insurance, acute healthcare, and legal markets. Gross margin remained relatively consistent at 68.9% for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 68.8% for the year ended December 31, 2022. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses as a percentage of net revenues in the year ended December 31, 2023 increased to 43.1%, as compared to 41.8% in the year ended December 31, 2022, due primarily to higher amortization of acquired intangibles from the acquisitions of Frontline and Syntellis and restructuring-related expenses incurred primarily in connection with the integration of the Syntellis acquisition. The resulting operating margin was 25.8% in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 27.1% in the year ended December 31, 2022.

Indicor – On November 22, 2022, Roper completed the divestiture of a majority 51 % stake in Indicor to CD&R for approximately $ 2,604 in cash. The consideration was comprised of a cash distribution of approximately $ 1,775 funded by third-party indebtedness incurred by Indicor and approximately $ 829 related to the majority 51 % equity stake. The Company retained an initial 49 % minority equity interest. The sale resulted in a pretax gain of $ 2,046.0 , which included $ 142.6 of foreign currency translation losses and $ 535.0 associated with the initial remaining 49 % interest in Indicor (described further in Note 10).

[337]: In our Application Software segment, net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $3,186.9 as compared to $2,639.5 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The growth of 5.9% in organic revenues was broad-based across the segment led by our businesses serving the government contracting, property and casualty insurance, acute healthcare, and legal markets. Gross margin remained relatively consistent at 68.9% for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 68.8% for the year ended December 31, 2022. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses as a percentage of net revenues in the year ended December 31, 2023 increased to 43.1%, as compared to 41.8% in the year ended December 31, 2022, due primarily to higher amortization of acquired intangibles from the acquisitions of Frontline and Syntellis and restructuring-related expenses incurred primarily in connection with the integration of the Syntellis acquisition. The resulting operating margin was 25.8% in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 27.1% in the year ended December 31, 2022.

Indicor – On November 22, 2022, Roper completed the divestiture of a majority 51 % stake in Indicor to CD&R for approximately $ 2,604 in cash. The consideration was comprised of a cash distribution of approximately $ 1,775 funded by third-party indebtedness incurred by Indicor and approximately $ 829 related to the majority 51 % equity stake. The Company retained an initial 49 % minority equity interest. The sale resulted in a pretax gain of $ 2,046.0 , which included $ 142.6 of foreign currency translation losses and $ 535.0 associated with the initial remaining 49 % interest in Indicor (described further in Note 10).

[339]: In our Technology Enabled Products segment, net revenues were $1,551.5 for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to $1,353.8 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The growth of 14.7% in organic revenues was broad-based across the segment led by our water meter technology business and medical products businesses. Gross margin increased to 57.1% in the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 56.9% in the year ended December 31, 2022, due primarily to operating leverage on higher organic revenues, partially offset by revenue mix. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues remained relatively consistent at 23.7% in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 23.8% in the year ended December 31, 2022. The resulting operating margin was 33.4% in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 33.2% in the year ended December 31, 2022.
[340]: Corporate expenses increased by $17.5 to $226.7, or 3.7% of revenues, in 2023 as compared to $209.2, or 3.9% of revenues, in 2022. The dollar increase was due primarily to higher compensation and acquisition-related expenses.

[335]: Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $6,177.8 as compared to $5,371.8 for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of 15.0%. The components of revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2023 were as follows:
[337]: In our Application Software segment, net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $3,186.9 as compared to $2,639.5 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The growth of 5.9% in organic revenues was broad-based across the segment led by our businesses serving the government contracting, property and casualty insurance, acute healthcare, and legal markets. Gross margin remained relatively consistent at 68.9% for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 68.8% for the year ended December 31, 2022. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses as a percentage of net revenues in the year ended December 31, 2023 increased to 43.1%, as compared to 41.8% in the year ended December 31, 2022, due primarily to higher amortization of acquired intangibles from the acquisitions of Frontline and Syntellis and restructuring-related expenses incurred primarily in connection with the integration of the Syntellis acquisition. The resulting operating margin was 25.8% in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 27.1% in the year ended December 31, 2022.

[335]: Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $6,177.8 as compared to $5,371.8 for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of 15.0%. The components of revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2023 were as follows:
[337]: In our Application Software segment, net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $3,186.9 as compared to $2,639.5 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The growth of 5.9% in organic revenues was broad-based across the segment led by our businesses serving the government contracting, property and casualty insurance, acute healthcare, and legal markets. Gross margin remained relatively consistent at 68.9% for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 68.8% for the year ended December 31, 2022. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses as a percentage of net revenues in the year ended December 31, 2023 increased to 43.1%, as compared to 41.8% in the year ended December 31, 2022, due primarily to higher amortization of acquired intangibles from the acquisitions of Frontline and Syntellis and restructuring-related expenses incurred primarily in connection with the integration of the Syntellis acquisition. The resulting operating margin was 25.8% in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 27.1% in the year ended December 31, 2022.

[339]: In our Technology Enabled Products segment, net revenues were $1,551.5 for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to $1,353.8 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The growth of 14.7% in organic revenues was broad-based across the segment led by our water meter technology business and medical products businesses. Gross margin increased to 57.1% in the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 56.9% in the year ended December 31, 2022, due primarily to operating leverage on higher organic revenues, partially offset by revenue mix. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues remained relatively consistent at 23.7% in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 23.8% in the year ended December 31, 2022. The resulting operating margin was 33.4% in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 33.2% in the year ended December 31, 2022.
[340]: Corporate expenses increased by $17.5 to $226.7, or 3.7% of revenues, in 2023 as compared to $209.2, or 3.9% of revenues, in 2022. The dollar increase was due primarily to higher compensation and acquisition-related expenses.

The fragments start with a number in square brackets and then the actual text. The lower the number of the fragment, the earlier the fragment appeared in the document (reading from left to right, top to bottom).  


                    The question is: What are the revenues for the 12 month period ending december 2023?  possible values: any number (positive or negative, including decimals)
 We also want to retrieve some meta information. In the following we will present the meta item ID and then the additional question to be answered, format: (META_ID): QUESTION.
(currency): What is the currency  possible values (select one from json array): ['USD', 'EUR', 'Other']
(unit): What is the unit?  possible values (select one from json array): ['none', 'thousands', 'millions', 'billions'] 

                    
                     


                    Your answer should be formatted as a JSON object. Under the key 'answers' can be one or more JSON object(s), with key value pairs for the main question and the meta items. For the main question use the key 'main_question', for the meta items use their ID as key. Under the key 'sources', you should also provide the numbers of the text fragments you used to answer the question. For example your answer could look like this: {""answers"": [{""main_question"": ""123"", ""currency"": ""USD"", ""unit"": ""none""}], ""sources"": [241, 423]}

[1275]: As of December 31, 2023, the Company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to product development, raising capital and building infrastructure and has not generated any revenues from any sales of its therapeutic products. To date, the Company’s revenues have been derived from collaboration agreements and government grants.
[1276]: Use of Estimates The Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements requires it to make estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The most significant estimates in the Company’s consolidated financial statements relate to its stock appreciation milestone obligations, contracts containing leases, and accrued expenses. Although these estimates are based on the Company’s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately materially differ from these estimates and assumptions.

[1116]: Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
[1117]: Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to the fair value of the stock price appreciation milestones for the Amended MSKCC License, contracts containing leases, accrued expenses, stock-based compensation, and the estimated total costs expected to be incurred under our collaboration agreements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, financial models, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
[1105]: General and Administrative Expenses
[1106]: General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation, for our employees in executive, operational, finance and human resource functions; professional fees for accounting, legal and tax services; costs for obtaining, prosecuting, maintaining, and enforcing our intellectual property; and other costs and fees, including director and officer insurance premiums, to support our operations as a public company. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will remain significant in the future as we maintain our focus on innovation, and research and development activities, maintain compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements, protect and enforce our intellectual property, and continue to operate as a public company.
[1107]: Other Income (Expense)
[1108]: Other income (expense) consists of changes in the fair value of stock price appreciation milestones associated with the Amended and Restated Exclusive License Agreement dated May 15, 2018 (Amended MSKCC License) with MSKCC, interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents and interest income from investments (including the amortization of discounts and premiums).
[1141]: The fair value of our restricted stock units, including performance-based restricted stock units, is based on the closing price of our common stock as reported on The NASDAQ Global Market on the date of grant.
[1142]: Recent Accounting Pronouncements
[1143]: For a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements, please see Note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

[1146]: The following table summarizes the results of our operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:
[1148]: Revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized revenue of $63.5 million under our collaboration agreements with Janssen and Ono. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized revenue of $96.3 million under our collaboration agreements with Janssen and Ono. The decrease in revenue was attributable primarily to the termination of our collaboration with Janssen in April 2023. The following table summarizes the revenue recognized with respect to each collaboration partner for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:

[1055]: We were incorporated in Delaware in 2007 and are headquartered in San Diego, California. Since our inception in 2007, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our cell programming approach and the research and development of our product candidates, the creation, licensing and protection of related intellectual property, and the provision of general and administrative support for these activities. To date, we have funded our operations primarily through the public and private sale of common stock, the private placement of preferred stock and convertible notes, commercial bank debt and revenues from collaboration activities and grants.
[1056]: We have never been profitable and have incurred net losses in each year since inception. Substantially all of our net losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to continue to incur operating losses for at least the foreseeable future. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. We expect our expenses will remain significant in connection with our ongoing and planned activities as we:
[1227]: Basis for Opinion
[1228]: These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
[1229]: We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
[1294]: Revenue Recognition The Company analyzes its collaboration arrangements to assess whether they are within the scope of ASC 808, to determine whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards that are dependent on the commercial success of such activities. If the Company concludes that some or all aspects of the arrangement represent a transaction with a customer, the Company accounts for those aspects of the arrangement within the scope of ASC 606. For arrangements attributable to ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of control of a product or a service to a customer and reflects the amount of the consideration the Company is entitled to receive in exchange for such product or service. In doing so, the Company follows a five-step approach: (i) identify the contract with a customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the customer obtains control of the product or service.
[1038]: Securities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans
[1039]: Information about our equity compensation plans is incorporated herein by reference to Item 12 of Part III of this Annual Report.
[1040]: Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities
[1041]: During the year ended December 31, 2023, we did not issue or sell any unregistered securities not previously disclosed in a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or in a Current Report on Form 8-K.
[1042]: Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
[1043]: We did not repurchase any securities during the year ended December 31, 2023.

[536]: Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
[537]: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
[538]: Some of these estimates and assumptions include judgments on revenue recognition, estimates for common area maintenance and real estate tax accruals, provisions for uncollectible accounts, impairment of long-lived assets, the allocation of purchase price between tangible and intangible assets, capitalization of costs and fair value measurements. The Company’s significant accounting policies and estimates are described in more detail in Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Company’s Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. However, the following policies are deemed to be critical:
[830]: The Management Companies provide property management, leasing, corporate, development, redevelopment and acquisition services to affiliated and non-affiliated shopping centers. In consideration for these services, the Management Companies receive monthly management fees generally ranging from 1.5 % to 4 % of the gross monthly rental revenue of the properties managed.
[831]: Property: Maintenance and repair expenses are charged to operations as incurred. Costs for major replacements and betterments, which includes HVAC equipment, roofs, parking lots, etc., are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Gains and losses are recognized upon disposal or retirement of the related assets and are reflected in earnings.

[133]: Table element - Text before table: Anchor space over 10,000 square feet is not physically connected to the mall, does not share the same common area amenities and does not benefit from the foot traffic in the mall.  As a result, space greater than 10,000 square feet has a unique rent structure that is inconsistent with mall space under 10,000 square feet.
Cost of Occupancy:
A major factor contributing to tenant profitability is cost of occupancy, which consists of tenant occupancy costs charged by the Company. Tenant occupancy costs include tenant expenses such as minimum rents, percentage rents and recoverable expenditures, which consist primarily of property operating expenses and real estate taxes. These costs are then compared to tenant sales to present tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of tenant sales. A low cost of occupancy percentage shows more potential capacity for the Company to increase rents at the time of lease renewal than a high cost of occupancy percentage.

The tables below set forth information about the Company’s reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 along with the items necessary to reconcile the segment information to the totals reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Segment assets are not reviewed by the Company’s chief operating decision maker function and therefore are not disclosed below.
Segment operating income consists of revenue generated by a segment, less the direct costs of service revenues and general and administrative expenses that are incurred directly by the segment. Unallocated general and administrative costs are those costs for functions performed in a centralized manner and therefore not attributable to a particular segment. These costs include accounting, finance, human resources, legal, information technology, corporate office support and facility costs and overall corporate management.; table: (row 0)

[601]: Gross profit, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues, was 37.0% and 30.4% for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net service revenues was due to a decrease of 6.6% in direct payroll expense as a percentage of net service revenues.
[602]: The home health segment’s general and administrative expenses consist of administrative employee wages, taxes and benefit costs, rent, information technology and office expenses. General and administrative expenses, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues, was 24.7% and 23.9% for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to acquisitions that resulted in a $3.1 million increase in administrative employee wages, taxes and benefit costs and a $0.3 million increase in rent expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023.
[603]: Non-GAAP Financial Measures
[604]: Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). The financial results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully evaluated.
[1017]: Segment operating income consists of revenue generated by a segment, less the direct costs of service revenues and general and administrative expenses that are incurred directly by the segment. Unallocated general and administrative costs are those costs for functions performed in a centralized manner and therefore not attributable to a particular segment. These costs include accounting, finance, human resources, legal, information technology, corporate office support and facility costs and overall corporate management.

The tables below set forth information about the Company’s reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 along with the items necessary to reconcile the segment information to the totals reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Segment assets are not reviewed by the Company’s chief operating decision maker function and therefore are not disclosed below.
Segment operating income consists of revenue generated by a segment, less the direct costs of service revenues and general and administrative expenses that are incurred directly by the segment. Unallocated general and administrative costs are those costs for functions performed in a centralized manner and therefore not attributable to a particular segment. These costs include accounting, finance, human resources, legal, information technology, corporate office support and facility costs and overall corporate management.; table: (row 0)

The tables below set forth information about the Company’s reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 along with the items necessary to reconcile the segment information to the totals reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Segment assets are not reviewed by the Company’s chief operating decision maker function and therefore are not disclosed below.
Segment operating income consists of revenue generated by a segment, less the direct costs of service revenues and general and administrative expenses that are incurred directly by the segment. Unallocated general and administrative costs are those costs for functions performed in a centralized manner and therefore not attributable to a particular segment. These costs include accounting, finance, human resources, legal, information technology, corporate office support and facility costs and overall corporate management.; table: (row 0)

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

 (col 1): Accounting for revenue from collaboration agreements (row end);
 (row 2) 
 (col 0): Description of the Matter (col 1): The Company recorded revenue from collaboration agreements of $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company enters into collaboration agreements under which the Company licenses rights to certain of its product candidates and performs research and development services. Amounts received under these arrangements typically include non-refundable upfront fees, reimbursement of research and development costs, development, regulatory, and commercial milestone payments, and royalties on net sales of licensed products. Auditing the Company’s accounting for revenues from collaboration arrangements was complex and required significant judgments primarily in identifying the performance obligations, including whether options to provide license rights represent material rights, the determination of estimated selling prices and the allocation of the arrangement consideration to the performance obligations. (row end);
 (row 3) 
 (col 0): How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit (col 1): To test the accounting for revenue from collaboration arrangements, our audit procedures included, among others, inspecting the collaboration agreement, assessing the appropriateness of the Company’s technical accounting analyses and testing the application of the applicable accounting guidance. This included testing the completeness and appropriateness of the Company’s identification of performance obligations. We evaluated the determination of the estimated selling prices used to allocate arrangement consideration to the performance obligations, as well as the determination of any significant and incremental discount present in customer options and tested the underlying data used in the analysis. We also assessed the consistency of the judgments and related conclusions to other similar arrangements and evaluated any contrary evidence identified. (row end);

[1828]: In periods in which the Company reports a net loss, diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share, since dilutive common shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive. The Company reported a net loss for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 .
[1829]: Segment and geographic information
[1830]: Operating segments are defined as components of an entity about which separate discrete information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The CODM is the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. The Company views its operations as and manages its business in one operating segment operating exclusively in the United States.
[1831]: Subsequent events
[1832]: The Company performs an evaluation of all subsequent events after the balance sheet date through the date of issuance of the consolidated financial statements to ensure appropriate disclosure of events both recognized in the consolidated financial statements and events which occurred subsequently but were not recognized in the consolidated financial statements.
[1645]: Critical accounting policies and significant judgments
[1646]: This management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

[1647]: While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2, Summary of significant accounting policies, to our consolidated financial statements, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
[1648]: • revenue recognition; and
[1649]: • accrued research and development expenses.
[1650]: Revenue Recognition
[1651]: We enter into collaboration agreements which are within the scope of Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , or ASC 606, under which we license rights to certain of our product candidates and perform research and development services. The terms of these arrangements typically include payment of one or more of the following: non-refundable, upfront fees; reimbursement of research and
[1652]: 139
[1653]: development costs; development, regulatory, and commercial milestone payments; and royalties on net sales of licensed products.
[1654]: Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized for arrangements determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we perform the following five steps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) we satisfy each performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. The areas of our revenue recognition policy that contain significant judgment include the determination of performance obligations, including customer options, the determination of estimated selling prices and the allocation of transaction price to our identified performance obligations.
[1958]: 13. Income taxes
[1959]: The Company's losses before income taxes consist solely of losses from domestic operations, which totaled $ 199.8 million , $ 157.3 million and $ 120.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.
[1960]: Income tax expense (benefit) is summarized as follows:
[1962]: F- 30
[1963]: A reconciliation of the income tax expense computed using the federal statutory income tax rate to the Company’s effective income tax rate is as follows:
[1965]: F- 31
[1966]: Deferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes. The significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 are comprised of the following :
[1968]: The Company has incurred net operating losses in each year since inception. Management has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of the Company’s net deferred tax assets, which are comprised primarily of net operating loss carryforwards, tax credits, and costs capitalized for tax purposes. Management has considered the Company’s history of cumulative net losses in the United States and estimated future tax losses and has determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will not recognize the benefits of the net deferred tax assets. As a result, the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance at December 31, 2023 and 2022. The valuation allowance increased by $ 62.5 million in 2023, due to the increase in deferred tax assets, primarily due to net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards, and increase in deferred tax assets associated with current year temporary items.
[1393]: • announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, in-licensing arrangements, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or collaborations;
[1394]: • developments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other intellectual property or proprietary rights;
[1395]: • the recruitment or departure of key personnel;
[1396]: • the level of expenses related to any of our product candidates or clinical development programs;
[1397]: • the results of our efforts to discover, develop, acquire or in-license products, product candidates, technologies, the costs of commercializing any such products and the costs of development of any such product candidates or technologies;
[1398]: • actual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;
[1399]: • announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts;
[1400]: • variations in our financial results or the financial results of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;
[1401]: • sales of common stock by us, our executive officers, directors or principal stockholders, or others;

[682]: Revenue Recognition
[683]: Upstream Revenues
[684]: Upstream revenues include the sale of oil, gas and NGL production. Oil, gas and NGL sales are recognized when production is sold to a purchaser at a fixed or determinable price, delivery has occurred, control has transferred and collectability of the revenue is probable. Devon’s performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time. This occurs when control is transferred to the purchaser upon delivery of contract-specified production volumes at a specified point. The transaction price used to recognize revenue is a function of the contract billing terms. Revenue is invoiced, if required, by calendar month based on volumes at contractually based rates with payment typically received within 30 days of the end of the production month. Taxes assessed by governmental authorities on oil, gas and NGL sales are presented separately from such revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings.

[693]: Marketing revenues are generated primarily as a result of Devon selling commodities purchased from third parties. Marketing revenues are recognized when performance obligations are satisfied. This occurs at the time contract-specified products are sold to third parties at a contractually fixed or determinable price, delivery occurs at a specified point or performance has occurred, control has transferred and collectability of the revenue is probable. The transaction price used to recognize revenue and invoice customers is based on a contractually stated fee or on a third party published index price plus or minus a known differential. Devon typically receives payment for invoiced amounts within 30 days. Marketing revenues and expenses attributable to oil, gas and NGL purchases are reported on a gross basis when Devon takes control of the products and has risks and rewards of ownership.

                    This is the available data to answer the question (in the following, if tables have empty cells, they are omitted, if a cell spans several columns, values might be repeated for each cell):
[201]: This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes discussions of operating revenue, net of fuel surcharge revenue; Truckload, Dedicated and Intermodal revenue, net of fuel surcharge revenue; operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, each net of fuel surcharge revenue; and net fuel expense (fuel and fuel taxes net of fuel surcharge revenue and surcharges passed through to independent contractors, outside drayage carriers and railroads). We provide these additional disclosures because management believes these measures provide a more consistent basis for comparing results of operations from period to period. These financial measures in this report have not been determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Pursuant to Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K, we have included the amounts necessary to reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures of operating revenue, operating expenses divided by operating revenue, and fuel and fuel taxes.
[365]: Revenue recognition: We account for our revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The current revenue standard requires us to recognize revenue and related expenses within each of our four reporting segments over time as our customers simultaneously receive and consume benefits as we perform the freight services. 40 We account for revenue of our Intermodal and Brokerage segments and revenue on freight transported by independent contractors within our Truckload and Dedicated segments on a gross basis because we are the principal service provider controlling the promised service before it is transferred to each customer. We are primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide each specified service to each customer. We bear the primary risk of loss in the event of cargo claims by our customers. We also have complete control and discretion in establishing the price for each specified service. Accordingly, all such revenue billed to customers is classified as operating revenue and all corresponding payments to carriers for transportation services we arrange in connection with brokerage and intermodal activities and to independent contractor providers of revenue equipment are classified as purchased transportation expense within our consolidated statements of operations. See Note 14 for more information. Our largest customer, Walmart, accounted for 19 % of our revenue excluding fuel surcharges in 2023 and 19 % of our trade receivables as of December 31, 2023, 21 % of our revenue in 2022 and 22 % of our trade receivables as of December 31, 2022, and 23 % of our revenue in 2021. During each of 2023, 2022 and 2021, approximately 99 % of our revenue was generated within the United States.
[462]: 51
[463]: The following table sets forth for the years indicated our operating revenue and operating income by segment. We do not prepare separate balance sheets by segment and, as a result, assets are not separately identifiable by segment.
[465]: Truckload segment depreciation expense was $ 61.6 million, $ 56.4 million and $ 52.1 million, Dedicated segment depreciation expense was $ 46.2 million, $ 45.6 million and $ 43.0 million, Intermodal segment depreciation expense was $ 7.1 million, $ 7.5 million and $ 6.3 million, and Brokerage segment depreciation expense was $ 1.9 million, $ 1.5 million and $ 1.2 million, in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
[466]: 52
[468]: None.
[470]: As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2023. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We intend to periodically evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures as required by the Exchange Act Rules.
[226]: 23
[227]: Gain on disposition of revenue equipment was $13.6 million in 2023, up slightly from $13.4 million in 2022 primarily due to an increase in the number of units sold, offset by a decrease in the average gain for our tractor and trailer sales. Future gains or losses on dispositions of revenue equipment will be impacted by the market for used revenue equipment, which is beyond our control.
[228]: Our operating income declined 37.1% to $90.1 million in 2023 from $143.3 million in 2022 as a result of the foregoing factors. Our operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, or “operating ratio,” was 92.0% in 2023 and 88.7% in 2022. The operating ratio for our Truckload segment was 94.7% in 2023 and 88.1% in 2022, for our Dedicated segment was 88.2% in each of 2023 and 2022, for our Intermodal segment was 100.2% in 2023 and 91.8% in 2022, and for our Brokerage segment was 89.7% in 2023 and 88.9% in 2022. Operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, with both amounts net of fuel surcharges, was 90.7% in 2023 and 86.4% in 2022.

The graph below compares the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock with the NASDAQ Market index and the SIC code 4213 (trucking, except local) line-of-business index for the last five years. Research Data Group, Inc. prepared the line-of-business index. The graph assumes $100 is invested in our common stock, the NASDAQ Stock Market index and the line-of-business index on December 31, 2018, with reinvestment of dividends. The comparisons in the graph below are based on historical data and are not intended to forecast the possible future performance of our common stock.

[368]: Segment reporting: We report our operating segments in accordance with accounting standards codified in FASB ASC 280, Segment Reporting . We have five current operating segments that are aggregated into four reporting segments (Truckload, Dedicated, Intermodal and Brokerage) for financial reporting purposes. See Note 14 for more information.
[369]: Use of estimates: We must make estimates and assumptions to prepare the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are primarily related to insurance and claims accruals and depreciation. Ultimate results could differ from these estimates.

[280]: Table element - Text before table: We have historically been able to pass through a significant portion of long-term increases in diesel fuel prices and related taxes to customers in the form of fuel surcharges. Fuel surcharge programs are widely accepted among our customers, though they can vary somewhat from customer-to-customer. These fuel surcharges, which adjust weekly with the cost of fuel, enable us to recover a substantial portion of the higher cost of fuel as prices increase. These fuel surcharge provisions are not effective in mitigating the fuel price increases related to non-revenue miles or fuel used while the tractor is idling. In addition, we have worked diligently to control fuel usage and costs by improving our volume purchasing arrangements and optimizing our drivers’ fuel purchases with national fuel centers, focusing on shorter lengths of haul, installing and tightly managing the use of auxiliary power units in our tractors to minimize engine idling and improving fuel usage in our trailers’ refrigeration units.
While we do not currently have any outstanding hedging instruments to mitigate this market risk, we may enter into derivatives or other financial instruments to hedge a portion of our fuel costs in the future.

[208]: The following table sets forth for the years indicated our operating revenue, operating income and operating ratio by segment, along with the change for each component:
[210]: Our operating revenue decreased $132.4 million, or 10.5%, to $1.131 billion in 2023 from $1.264 billion in 2022. Our operating revenue, net of fuel surcharges, decreased $81.4 million, or 7.7%, to $972.0 million in 2023 from $1.053 billion in 2022. This decrease in 2023 was due to a $38.9 million decrease in Brokerage revenue, a $24.6 million decrease in Intermodal revenue, net of fuel surcharges, a $15.9 million decrease in Truckload revenue, net of fuel surcharges, and a $2.0 million decrease in Dedicated revenue, net of fuel surcharges.

The fragments start with a number in square brackets and then the actual text. The lower the number of the fragment, the earlier the fragment appeared in the document (reading from left to right, top to bottom).  


                    The question is: What are the revenues for the 12 month period ending december 2023?  possible values: any number (positive or negative, including decimals)
 We also want to retrieve some meta information. In the following we will present the meta item ID and then the additional question to be answered, format: (META_ID): QUESTION.
(currency): What is the currency  possible values (select one from json array): ['USD', 'EUR', 'Other']
(unit): What is the unit?  possible values (select one from json array): ['none', 'thousands', 'millions', 'billions'] 

                    
                     


                    Your answer should be formatted as a JSON object. Under the key 'answers' can be one or more JSON object(s), with key value pairs for the main question and the meta items. For the main question use the key 'main_question', for the meta items use their ID as key. Under the key 'sources', you should also provide the numbers of the text fragments you used to answer the question. For example your answer could look like this: {""answers"": [{""main_question"": ""123"", ""currency"": ""USD"", ""unit"": ""none""}], ""sources"": [241, 423]} 

                    
                    This is the available data to answer the question (in the following, if tables have empty cells, they are omitted, if a cell spans several columns, values might be repeated for each cell):

[207]: Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2023 to Year Ended December 31, 2022
[208]: The following table sets forth for the years indicated our operating revenue, operating income and operating ratio by segment, along with the change for each component:
[210]: Our operating revenue decreased $132.4 million, or 10.5%, to $1.131 billion in 2023 from $1.264 billion in 2022. Our operating revenue, net of fuel surcharges, decreased $81.4 million, or 7.7%, to $972.0 million in 2023 from $1.053 billion in 2022. This decrease in 2023 was due to a $38.9 million decrease in Brokerage revenue, a $24.6 million decrease in Intermodal revenue, net of fuel surcharges, a $15.9 million decrease in Truckload revenue, net of fuel surcharges, and a $2.0 million decrease in Dedicated revenue, net of fuel surcharges. Fuel surcharge revenue decreased to $159.4 million in 2023 from $210.4 million in 2022.

[714]: Revenue Recognition
[715]: The Company’s revenue was $881.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. As described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, management recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the customer. The transfer of control generally occurs upon shipment when title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The vast majority of the Company’s revenue is generated from the sale of distinct products. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for such products, which is generally at contractually stated prices.
[716]: The principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition is a critical audit matter is a high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures related to the Company’s revenue recognition.
[717]: Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing the completeness, accuracy and existence of revenue recognized for a sample of revenue transactions by obtaining and inspecting source documents, including purchase orders, invoices, and proof of shipment and (ii) confirming a sample of outstanding customer invoice balances as of December 31, 2023 and, for confirmations not returned, obtaining and inspecting source documents, including invoices, proof of shipment, and subsequent cash receipts, where applicable.

[1072]: 18. Segment Information
[1073]: Reportable Segments
[1074]: The Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) is the Chief Executive Officer. The CODM utilizes financial information to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. The Company evaluates the performance of, and allocates resources to, its segments based on revenue, gross profit and operating profit. The Company’s reportable segments have been identified based on commonality and adjacency of technologies, applications and customers amongst the Company’s individual product lines. The Company determined that disclosing revenue by specific product was impracticable due to the highly customized and extensive portfolio of technologies offered to customers.
[1075]: Based upon the information provided to the CODM, the Company has determined it operates in three reportable segments: Precision Medicine and Manufacturing, Medical Solutions, and Robotics and Automation. The reportable segments and their principal activities are summarized below:
[779]: Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. Advertising costs were not material for 2023, 2022 and 2021.
[780]: Restructuring, Acquisition and Related Costs The Company accounts for its restructuring activities in accordance with the provisions of ASC 420, “Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations.” The Company makes assumptions related to the amounts of employee severance benefits and related costs, useful lives and residual value of long-lived assets, and discount rates. Estimates and assumptions are based on the best information available at the time the obligation is recognized. These estimates are reviewed and revised as facts and circumstances dictate. Acquisition related costs incurred to effect a business combination, including finders’ fees, legal, valuation and other professional or consulting fees, are expensed as incurred. Acquisition related costs also include expenses recognized under earn-out agreements in connection with acquisitions.
[513]: Overview of Financial Results
[514]: Total revenue for 2023 was $881.7 million, an increase of $20.8 million, or 2.4%, versus 2022. This increase was primarily due to increased demand in the medical markets and revenue from a prior year acquisition. The effect of our prior year acquisition resulted in an increase in revenue of $8.1 million, or 0.9%. In addition, foreign exchange rates favorably impacted our revenue by $1.3 million, or 0.2%, in 2023.
[515]: Operating income for 2023 was $110.5 million, an increase of $7.4 million, or 7.2%, versus 2022. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit of $21.4 million primarily attributable to higher revenue and a decrease in amortization expense of $5.9 million, partially offset by an increase in restructuring, acquisition and related charges of $8.4 million, research and development and engineering (“R&D”) expenses of $5.9 million, and selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses of $5.6 million.
[516]: Basic earnings per common share (“basic EPS”) of $2.03 in 2023 decreased $0.05 from the basic EPS of $2.08 in 2022. Diluted earnings per common share (“diluted EPS”) of $2.02 in 2023 decreased $0.04 from the diluted EPS of $2.06 in 2022. The decreases in basic EPS and diluted EPS were primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense, partially offset by an increase in operating income and a decrease in income tax provision.
[301]: 20
[302]: regular operations. Managing a larger and more geographically dispersed operation and product portfolio could also pose challenges for our management team.
[303]: Further, our ability to maintain and increase the profitability of acquired businesses will depend on our ability to manage and control operating expenses and to generate and sustain increased levels of revenue. Our expectations to achieve more consistent and predictable levels of revenue and to increase profitability as a result of any acquisition may not be realized. Such revenues and profitability may even decline as we integrate newly acquired operations into our existing businesses. We may fail to identify inherent weaknesses in acquired businesses or misinterpret market and technology trends and growth potentials during our acquisition due diligence process. If revenues of acquired businesses decline or grow more slowly than we anticipate, or if their operating expenses are higher than we expect, we may not be able to sustain or increase their profitability, in which case we may not be able to realize the expected return on our investments, our financial condition will suffer, and our stock price could decline. In addition, through our acquisitions, we may assume liabilities, losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or insured or for which our indemnity or insurance is inadequate. Any such liabilities may have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.
[82]: Table element - Text before table: Segments
During the first quarter of 2023, we changed the names of our reportable segments from “Photonics” to “Precision Medicine and Manufacturing”, from “Vision” to “Medical Solutions”, and from “Precision Motion” to “Robotics and Automation”, respectively. The segment name changes did not result in any change to the compositions of our segments and therefore did not result in any change to historical results.
We have determined that we have three reportable segments. Our reportable segments have been identified based on commonality and adjacency of technologies, applications, and customers amongst our individual product lines. We evaluate the performance of, and allocate resources to, our segments based on revenue, gross profit and operating profit. The following table shows the external revenues, gross profit margin and operating profit for each of the segments for the year ended December 31, 2023 (dollars in millions):; table: (row 0)

[638]: Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”.
