Explanation:

- The main question asks for the revenues for the 12 month period ending December 2023. According to the table in fragment [409], the total sales for the year ended December 31, 2023, are $8,000,342 (in thousands). Therefore, the revenue in millions is $8,000.342. However, since the question asks for the revenues attributable to Skechers U.S.A., Inc., we need to subtract the net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest, which is $104,124 (in thousands) or $104.124 million. Thus, the revenues attributable to Skechers U.S.A., Inc. are $8,000.342 - $104.124 = $7,896.218 million. However, since the question asks for the revenues and not the net earnings, we should consider the total sales of $8,000.342 million.
- The currency is USD, as indicated in the table headers.
- The unit is millions, as the table values are given in thousands and we need to convert them to millions to answer the question.","You are supposed to answer a question based on text fragments that are provided.

[821]: Table element - Text before table: Regulatory balancing account revenue Regulatory balancing account revenue is revenue related to revenue mechanisms authorized in California by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), which the Company recognizes as revenue when it is objectively determinable, probable of recovery and expected to be collected within 24 months following the end of the accounting period. Regulatory balancing account revenues are not considered contracts with customers. To the extent that revenue is estimated to be collectible beyond 24 months, recognition is deferred. Due to a delay in resolution of Cal Water's most recent general rate case filing in July of 2021 (2021 GRC), the Company did not recognize a benefit from regulatory revenue mechanisms in 2023. For 2022, the Company's authorized regulatory revenue mechanisms included the Water Revenue Adjustment Mechanism (WRAM). The WRAM decoupled revenue from the volume of the sales and allowed the Company to recognize the adopted level of volumetric revenues. The variance between adopted volumetric revenues and actual billed volumetric revenues for metered accounts was recorded as regulatory balancing accountÂ revenue. The WRAM concluded on December 31, 2022. Regulatory balancing accounts also includes revenue that is recognized for balancing accounts when it is probable that future recovery of previously incurred costs or future refunds that are to be credited to customers will occur through the ratemaking process.

Explanation:
The total revenues for the 12 month period ending December 31, 2023, are $1,777,710,000 (in thousands), which is equivalent to $1,777,710 million in USD. The source for this information is fragment [509].","You are supposed to answer a question based on text fragments that are provided. The fragments start with a number in square brackets and then the actual text. The lower the number of the fragment, the earlier the fragment appeared in the document (reading from left to right, top to bottom).  


                    The question is: What are the revenues for the 12 month period ending december 2023?  possible values: any number (positive or negative, including decimals)
 We also want to retrieve some meta information. In the following we will present the meta item ID and then the additional question to be answered, format: (META_ID): QUESTION.
(currency): What is the currency  possible values (select one from json array): ['USD', 'EUR', 'Other']
(unit): What is the unit?  possible values (select one from json array): ['none', 'thousands', 'millions', 'billions'] 

                    
                     


                    Your answer should be formatted as a JSON object. Under the key 'answers' can be one or more JSON object(s), with key value pairs for the main question and the meta items. For the main question use the key 'main_question', for the meta items use their ID as key. Under the key 'sources', you should also provide the numbers of the text fragments you used to answer the question. For example your answer could look like this: {""answers"": [{""main_question"": ""123"", ""currency"": ""USD"", ""unit"": ""none""}], ""sources"": [241, 423]}

[872]: Table element - Text before table: Note 12. Segments and Related Information
The Company has two reportable segments to align to its key geographies and go-to market strategy: North America (âNAMâ) and Europe & Rest of World (âE&RWâ). Operating segments have not been aggregated to form the reportable segments. The Company determined its reportable segments based on how the CODM reviews the Companyâs operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. The CODM reviews net sales, gross profit and segment income for each of the reportable segments. Gross profit is defined as net sales less cost of sales incurred by the segment. The CODM does not evaluate reportable segments using asset information as these are managed on an enterprise-wide basis. Segment income is defined as segment gross profit less selling, general and administrative expenses (âSG&Aâ) and RD&E. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. The NAM segment manufactures and sells residential and commercial swimming pool equipment and supplies as well as equipment that controls the flow of fluids. This segment is composed of three reporting units. The E&RW segment manufactures and sells residential and commercial swimming pool equipment and supplies. This segment is composed of two reporting units. The Company sells its products primarily through distributors and retailers.

Explanation:

- The revenues for the 12 month period ending December 2023 are not directly provided in the data. However, the ""Loss from operations"" for the year ended December 31, 2023 is given as ""-341,898"" in thousands of USD. This figure includes the cost of goods sold and other expenses. To find the net revenues, we would need additional information or make assumptions about these costs, which is not provided or suggested in the question. Therefore, the ""Loss from operations"" is used as a proxy for the revenues, indicating a negative revenue due to the loss.

- The currency is USD, as indicated by the ""$"" sign before the numbers in the table.

- The unit is ""thousands"", as indicated in the table header ""In thousands, except share and per share data"".","You are supposed to answer a question based on text fragments that are provided.

[822]: Table element - Text before table: Provision for taxes was $526 million and $573 million for the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, respectively, a decrease in income tax expense of $47 million. The decrease is primarily due to changes in income before taxes and tax reserve releases due to statute of limitation expirations. The decrease is offset by a reduction in our capacity to utilize foreign tax credits against U.S. foreign source income due to the increase in annual interest expense. As a result, we recorded a valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset related to future foreign tax credit benefits.

Explanation:
The revenues for the 12 month period ending December 2023 can be found in the table in fragment [259]. The table shows the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for Northwest Biotherapeutics, Inc. for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021. The revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023, are given as $1,932,000 in the ""Total revenues"" row. However, the question asks for the revenues in the 12 month period ending December 2023, which is the same as the revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023. Therefore, the answer is $1,932,000.

To convert the answer to the required format, we need to remove the dollar sign and the thousand separator, and add the negative sign because the company recognized a net loss. So, the answer becomes -62399000.

The currency is USD, as stated in the table.

The unit is thousands, as stated in the table.","```json

[132]: Table of Contents For theÂ Years Ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 We recognized a net loss of $62.6 million, $105.0 million and a net income of $179.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The net loss of $62.6 million and $105.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 included a non-cash gain of $1.5 million and a non-cash loss of $25.8 million from change in fair value derivative liabilities and convertible notes, respectively. The net income of $179.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 included a non-cash gain of $239.3 million from change in fair value derivative liabilities. Net cash used in operations was $53.6 million, $52.8 million and $38.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Research and development expense For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, research and development expense was $27.7 million, $35.5 million and $20.3 million, respectively. The increase in R&D in 2023 and 2022 as compared to 2021 was mainly reflected extensive one-time activities, which were started in mid of 2022 and fully completed as of December 31, 2023. The R&D expenses in 2023 and 2022 primarily reflected extensive one-time activities (i) to accomplish a number of pre-requisites that are required before making an application for regulatory of DCVax-L, (ii) to prepare the application package and (iii) to prepare other materials, such as the Trial Master File, to be inspection-ready in addition to the application package. The pre-requisites and preparations included developing, submitting and obtaining regulatory approval for a Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP), preparing and qualifying for manufacturing licenses required for the Sawston facility, completing the technology transfer from the London facility (where the Company had done all its manufacturing before 2022) to the Sawston facility to enable GMP manufacturing to begin in February 2022 at Sawston (while also continuing in the London facility), and six workstreams related to product matters involving Comparability, Stability, Potency, Product Profile, Mechanism of Action and Fill/Finish which are needed for the application package to seek regulatory approval of DCVax-L. The 2023 and 2022 R&D expenses we incurred for these activities included payments to numerous teams of specialized external consultants and the CRO, as well as to Advent BioServices. The majority of the payments to Advent were for one-time expenses for ten key one-time milestones for pre-requisites and preparations for the MAA application for product approval. These included three milestones for obtaining the three licenses required for the Sawston facility, six milestones for the six product workstreams, and 1 milestone related to preparing key portions of an application for regulatory approval of the DCVax-L product. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we completed the last three one-time milestones (obtaining a commercial manufacturing license from the MHRA, completion of drafting and submission of the application to MHRA for product approval), and recognized additional $1.5 million in research and development expense. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we paid $3.0 million for the cash component of seven milestones, and accrued $4.7 million for the cash component of future milestones. We issued 7.5 million shares at fair value of $5.9 million for the stock component of eight milestones, and we accrued $3.6 million for the stock component of future milestones. General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expenses were $29.7 million, $33.4 million and $33.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease of $3.6 million in 2023 compared to 2022 was mainly related to a decrease of $1.6 million in consulting, legal and professional fees, a decrease of $0.7 million in compensation expenses and a $0.9 million reduction in our director and officer insurance expenses. Expenses incurred in 2022 and 2021 were consistent with rounding, but there was a slight decrease of approximate $46,000 which was mainly related to a decrease of $7.0 million stock-based compensation that represented the vesting of a portion of previously granted equity-based awards, and that was recognized in general and administrative expense, and offset by an increase of approximately $1.8 million related to legal and professional expenses, an increase of $1.5 million in insurance premiums, an increase of $1.6 million related 29

[824]: Table element - Text before table: The Company generally leases its investment rental property to established tenants in the industrial, healthcare, restaurant, retail, and office property types. At December 31, 2023 , the Company had 796 real estate properties, 784 of which were leased under leases that have been classified as operating leases , nine that have been classified as direct financing leases, one that has been classified as a sales-type lease, and two that were vacant. Of the nine leases classified as direct financing leases , three include land portions which are accounted for as operating leases. The sales-type lease includes a land portion which is accounted for as an operating lease (see Revenue Recognition within Note 2). Most leases have initial terms of 10 to 20 years. The Companyâs leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of fixed increases, increases in the CPI, or increases in the tenantâs sales volume. Generally, tenants are also required to pay all property taxes and assessments, substantially maintain the interior and exterior of the building, and maintain property and liability insurance coverage. The leases also typically provide for one or more multiple year renewal options, at the election of the tenant, and are subject to generally the same terms and conditions as the initial lease.

Our CODM is our Chief Executive Officer, who regularly reviews our operating results on a consolidated basis. We operate as one segment and have one reportable segment. Based on the information provided to and reviewed by our CODM, we believe that the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows and how they are affected by economic factors are most appropriately depicted through our primary geographical markets and types of revenue categories (transaction revenues and revenues from other value added services).

[543]: Table element - Text before table: ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement (âASC 820â) defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three levels: Level 1 â quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities as well as certain U.S. Treasury securities that are highly liquid and are actively traded in secondary markets; Level 2 â observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted in active markets, but corroborated by market data; and Level 3 â unobservable inputs that are used when little or no market data is available.Â  The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs and the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs. In determining fair value, we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible as well as consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment of fair value.

[763]: Table element - Text before table: Business Combinations In October 2021, the FASB issued amended guidance on accounting for contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers in a business combination. The guidance is intended to address inconsistency related to recognition of an acquired contract liability and payment terms and their effect on subsequent revenue recognized. At the acquisition date, an entity should account for the related revenue contracts in accordance with existing revenue recognition guidance generally by assessing how the acquiree applied recognition and measurement in their financial statements. The guidance was adopted on January 1, 2023 and the adoption did not have an impact to the consolidated financial statements. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted Income Taxes In December 2023, the FASB issued amended guidance on income tax disclosures. The guidance is intended to provide additional disaggregation to the effective income tax rate reconciliation and income tax payment disclosures. The amended guidance is effective for annual periods beginning January 2025 and should be applied on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. Segment Reporting In November 2023, the FASB issued amended guidance for improvements to reportable segment disclosures. The revised guidance requires that a public entity disclose significant segment expenses regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (CODM), including public entities with a single reportable segment. The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning January 2024 and interim periods beginning January 2025 on a retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted.

[1057]: Table element - Text before table: MSUs are granted to executive officers. Vesting is conditioned upon continuous employment and occurs ratably over four years , subject to accelerated vesting in specified circumstances. The number of shares issued upon vesting of MSUs is determined based on a specified payout factor requiring that the market price per share at a specified measurement date be at least 80 % of the grant-date share price (market condition) for awards granted in 2023 ( 60 % prior to 2022). Attainment of a higher payout factor, calculated as the share price on measurement date divided by share price on award date, results in a higher percentage payout of MSUs, up to a maximum of 225 % of the target number of MSUs for awards granted in 2023 ( 200 % prior to 2022). The share price used in the payout factor is calculated using an average of the closing prices on the grant date or measurement date, and the nine trading days immediately preceding the grant date or measurement date.
PSUs are granted to executive officers, have a three-year performance cycle and are granted as a target number of stock units subject to adjustment.

[1366]: Table element - Text before table: Foreign Currency Forward Contracts . We also use foreign currency forward contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities. As a result of foreign currency fluctuations, the U.S. Dollar equivalent values of our foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities change. Gains and losses on these contracts are included in other income (expense), on a net basis, along with the foreign currency gains and losses of the related foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities associated with these foreign currency forward contracts. As of DecemberÂ 31, 2023 and 2022, the total notional amounts of these foreign currency contracts were $ 3.1 billion and $ 3.0 billion, respectively.
Cross-currency Interest Rate Swaps. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we elected to de-designate a portion of our cross-currency interest rate swaps previously designated as net investment hedges. Gains and losses subsequent to the de-designation will be recognized in earnings to offset remeasurement gains and losses from foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities. We also entered into $ 283.4 million of cross-currency interest rate swaps, which were not designated as hedging instruments. As of DecemberÂ 31, 2023, the total notional amount of cross-currency interest rate swaps which were not designated as hedging instruments was $ 1.1 billion.

[725]: Table element - Text before table: Other Income (Expense). Other income (expense) was $35 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to no other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2022. Higher interest rates and increased balances in our interest-bearing cash accounts contributed to an increase in interest income. Additionally, higher interest rates and the increase in PDP balances contributed to greater capitalized interest. Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 due to increased rates and balances as compared to the prior period and interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was unfavorably impacted by a $7 million non-cash charge from the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the repayment of the Treasury Loan.
Income Taxes. Our income tax expense was $43 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to an $8 million benefit for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 134.4%, primarily due to a $37 million valuation allowance recorded in December 2023 against our U.S. federal and state net operating loss deferred tax assets, which expire from one year to having no expiration, as a result of being in a three-year cumulative pre-tax loss position and limitations on compensation provided to certain executives pursuant to Internal Revenue Code section 162(m), partially offset by benefits recognized on the exercise of expiring stock options.

[603]: Table element - Text before table: Foreign Currency Translation Operations in our subsidiaries outside the United States (U.S.) are recorded in the functional currency of each subsidiary which is determined by a review of the environment where each subsidiary primarily generates and expends cash. The results of operations for our subsidiaries outside the U.S. are translated from functional currencies into U.S. dollars using the weighted-average currency rate for the period. Assets and liabilities are translated using the period end exchange rates. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from translating the net assets of these subsidiaries are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). Advertising Expenses Costs associated with advertising are expensed as incurred and are included in marketing, selling, and administrative expenses. Advertising expenses, comprised primarily of online marketing and television advertising, totaled $ 1.12 billion, $ 966.8 million, and $ 1.24 billion in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, which was less than 5 percent of revenue each year. Other Significant Accounting Policies Our other significant accounting policies are described in the remaining appropriate notes to the consolidated financial statements. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to conform with the current presentation. Development milestone payments related to externally developed IPR&D projects, acquired directly in a transaction other than a business combination, were previously included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows and are now included in purchases of IPR&D in cash flows from investing activities. The reclassification resulted in an increase to net cash provided by operating activities and net cash used in investing activities of $ 501.3 million and $ 105.2 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.

[1503]: Table element - Text before table: On October 9, 2023, the SED submitted for adoption by the CPUC a draft resolution approving an Administrative Consent Order and Agreement between the SED and the Utility (the âDixie ACOâ).  The Dixie ACO would resolve the SEDâs investigation into the 2021 Dixie fire.  The Dixie ACO provides that the Utility would (i) pay $ 2.5 million to Californiaâs General Fund; (ii) pay $ 2.5 million to tribes impacted by the 2021 Dixie fire; (iii) and undertake an initiative to transition to electronic records for specified patrols and inspections of distribution facilities, at an approximate cost of $ 40 million over five years , and the Utility may not seek recovery of such costs.  The SED agreed to refrain from instituting any further enforcement proceedings against the Utility related to the 2021 Dixie fire.  The Dixie ACO states that it does not constitute an admission or evidence of any wrongdoing, fault, omission, negligence, imprudence, or liability on the part of the Utility.  The Dixie ACO also states that the parties to it intend that it shall not affect whether the Utility may obtain recovery of costs and expenses incurred in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire, including for amounts drawn from the Wildfire Fund or otherwise sought through a cost recovery application to the CPUC.  On February 2, 2024, the CPUC issued a final decision approving the Dixie ACO.  In connection with the Dixie ACO, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded a liability of $ 5 million reflected in Other current liabilities on the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2023.  For the recordkeeping initiative costs for which the Utility will not seek recovery, the Utility expects to record disallowances as such costs are incurred. As of FebruaryÂ 14, 2024, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are aware of approximately 161 complaints on behalf of at least 8,387 individual plaintiffs and a separate putative class complaint related to the 2021 Dixie fire and expect that they may receive further complaints.  The plaintiffs seek damages that include wrongful death, property damage, economic loss, medical monitoring, punitive damages, exemplary damages, attorneysâ fees and other damages.  On September 20, 2023, the court vacated the November 8, 2023 trial date and scheduled a new trial date for April 2, 2024.  On June 30, 2023, Cal Fire also filed a complaint largely repeating the allegations of the earlier Cal Fire Investigation Report and seeking damages for fire suppression and investigation costs. On January 17, 2023, PG&E Corporation and the Utility reached an agreement with certain public entities to settle their claims for $ 24 million. On March 2, 2023, PG&E Corporation and the Utility entered into an agreement with the insurance subrogation plaintiffs in the 2021 Dixie fire litigation to resolve their claims arising from the 2021 Dixie fire. Based on the current state of the law concerning inverse condemnation in California and the facts and circumstances available to PG&E Corporation and the Utility as of the date of this filing, including Cal Fireâs determination of the cause and the information gathered as part of PG&E Corporationâs and the Utilityâs investigation, PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe it is probable that they will incur a loss in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded a liability in the aggregate amount of $ 1.175 billion as of December 31, 2022 (before available recoveries).  Based on the facts and circumstances available to PG&E Corporation and the Utility as of the date of this filing, including their experience to date in settling the claims of individual plaintiffs, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded an additional charge in the third quarter of 2023 for probable losses in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire of $ 425 million for an aggregate liability of $ 1.6 billion (before available insurance) as of December 31, 2023. PG&E Corporationâs and the Utilityâs accrued estimated losses of $ 1.6 billion do not include, among other things: (i) any amounts for potential penalties or fines that may be imposed by courts or other governmental entities on PG&E Corporation or the Utility, (ii) any punitive damages, (iii) any amounts in respect of compensation claims by federal or state agencies including for state or federal fire suppression costs and damages related to federal land, (iv) medical monitoring costs, or (v) any other amounts that are not reasonably estimable. As noted above, the aggregate estimated liability for claims in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire does not include potential claims for fire suppression costs from federal, state, county, or local agencies or damage to land and vegetation in national parks or national forests.  As to these damages, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have not concluded that a loss is probable.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to reasonably estimate the range of possible losses for any such claims due to, among other factors, incomplete information as to facts pertinent to potential claims and defenses, as well as facts that would bear on the amount, type, and valuation of vegetation loss, potential reforestation, habitat loss, and other resources damaged or destroyed by the 2021 Dixie fire.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe, however, that such losses could be significant with respect to fire suppression costs due to the size and duration of the 2021 Dixie fire and corresponding magnitude of fire suppression resources dedicated to fighting the 2021 Dixie fire and with respect to claims for damage to land and vegetation in national parks or national forests due to the very large number of acres of national parks and national forests that were affected by the 2021 Dixie fire.  According to the Cal Fire Investigation Report, over $ 650 million of costs had been incurred in suppressing the 2021 Dixie fire.  The Utility estimates that the fire burned approximately 70,000 acres of national parks and approximately 685,000 acres of national forests.

[615]: Table element - Text before table: We are subject to federal, state and foreign income taxes for jurisdictions in which we operate, and we use estimates in determining our income tax provision and deferred tax assets. Earnings from our non-U.S. activities are subject to income taxes in the local countries at rates which are generally similar to the U.S. statutory tax rate. We regularly assess the realizability of our net deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2023, valuation allowances remain in certain jurisdictions where we believe it is necessary to see further positive evidence, such as sustained achievement of sufficient profits to meet a more likely than not stance that the valuation allowance should be reversed. If additional positive evidence becomes available in the foreseeable future, we may release all or a portion of the valuation allowance. The exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release is subject to change based on the level of profitability achieved in future periods. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and a corresponding decrease to income tax expense in the period the release is recorded.

                    This is the available data to answer the question (in the following, if tables have empty cells, they are omitted, if a cell spans several columns, values might be repeated for each cell):
[335]: Net revenues for the year ended DecemberÂ 31, 2023 were $6,177.8 as compared to $5,371.8 for the year ended DecemberÂ 31, 2022, an increase of 15.0%. The components of revenue growth for the year ended DecemberÂ 31, 2023 were as follows:
[337]: In our Application Software segment, net revenues for the year ended DecemberÂ 31, 2023 were $3,186.9 as compared to $2,639.5 for the year ended DecemberÂ 31, 2022. The growth of 5.9% in organic revenues was broad-based across the segment led by our businesses serving the government contracting, property and casualty insurance, acute healthcare, and legal markets. Gross margin remained relatively consistent at 68.9% for the year ended DecemberÂ 31, 2023 as compared to 68.8% for the year ended DecemberÂ 31, 2022. Selling, general and administrative (âSG&Aâ) expenses as a percentage of net revenues in the year ended DecemberÂ 31, 2023 increased to 43.1%, as compared to 41.8% in the year ended DecemberÂ 31, 2022, due primarily to higher amortization of acquired intangibles from the acquisitions of Frontline and Syntellis and restructuring-related expenses incurred primarily in connection with the integration of the Syntellis acquisition. The resulting operating margin was 25.8% in the year ended DecemberÂ 31, 2023 as compared to 27.1% in the year ended DecemberÂ 31, 2022.

Explanation:

- The main question asks for the revenues for the 12 month period ending December 2023. The table in fragment [1252] provides this information. The collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 is $63,533 (in thousands). However, the question seems to be asking for the total revenues, not just the collaboration revenue. Since the total revenues are not provided, we can only provide the collaboration revenue.

- The meta item (currency) asks for the currency used. The table in fragment [1252] uses USD.

- The meta item (unit) asks for the unit used. The table in fragment [1252] uses thousands.

- The sources used to answer the question are included in the ""sources"" field. In this case, only fragment [1252] was used.","You are supposed to answer a question based on text fragments that are provided. The fragments start with a number in square brackets and then the actual text.

[133]: Table element - Text before table: Anchor space over 10,000 square feet is not physically connected to the mall, does not share the same common area amenities and does not benefit from the foot traffic in the mall.  As a result, space greater than 10,000 square feet has a unique rent structure that is inconsistent with mall space under 10,000 square feet.
Cost of Occupancy:
A major factor contributing to tenant profitability is cost of occupancy, which consists of tenant occupancy costs charged by the Company. Tenant occupancy costs include tenant expenses such as minimum rents, percentage rents and recoverable expenditures, which consist primarily of property operating expenses and real estate taxes. These costs are then compared to tenant sales to present tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of tenant sales. A low cost of occupancy percentage shows more potential capacity for the Company to increase rents at the time of lease renewal than a high cost of occupancy percentage. The following table summarizes occupancy costs for Mall Store and Freestanding Store tenants in the Centers as a percentage of total Mall Store sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022:; table: (row 0)

Segment assets are not reviewed by the Companyâs chief operating decision maker function and therefore are not disclosed below.
Segment operating income consists of revenue generated by a segment, less the direct costs of service revenues and general and administrative expenses that are incurred directly by the segment. Unallocated general and administrative costs are those costs for functions performed in a centralized manner and therefore not attributable to a particular segment.
