[473]: Table element - Text before table: Occupancy costs include fixed rents, property taxes, common area maintenance charges, general liability insurance, contingent rents, and other property costs. In 2023, occupancy costs increased $3.9 million or 10 basis points as a percentage of revenue compared to 2022. This increase is primarily driven by an increase in fixed rents related to the sale-leaseback of 18 locations and the acquisition of five restaurants from a franchisee, mostly offset by reduced expenses related to net Company-owned restaurant closures.

[872]: Table element - Text before table: Note 12. Segments and Related Information
The Company has two reportable segments to align to its key geographies and go-to market strategy: North America (“NAM”) and Europe & Rest of World (“E&RW”). Operating segments have not been aggregated to form the reportable segments. The Company determined its reportable segments based on how the CODM reviews the Company’s operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. The CODM reviews net sales, gross profit and segment income for each of the reportable segments. Gross profit is defined as net sales less cost of sales incurred by the segment. The CODM does not evaluate reportable segments using asset information as these are managed on an enterprise-wide basis. Segment income is defined as segment gross profit less selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) and RD&E. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. The NAM segment manufactures and sells residential and commercial swimming pool equipment and supplies as well as equipment that controls the flow of fluids. This segment is composed of three reporting units. The E&RW segment manufactures and sells residential and commercial swimming pool equipment and supplies. This segment is composed of two reporting units. The Company sells its products primarily through distributors and retailers. Financial information by reportable segment is included in the following summary (in thousands):

[822]: Table element - Text before table: Provision for taxes was $526 million and $573 million for the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, respectively, a decrease in income tax expense of $47 million. The decrease is primarily due to changes in income before taxes and tax reserve releases due to statute of limitation expirations. The decrease is offset by a reduction in our capacity to utilize foreign tax credits against U.S. foreign source income due to the increase in annual interest expense. As a result, we recorded a valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset related to future foreign tax credit benefits.

[132]: Table of Contents For the Years Ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 We recognized a net loss of $62.6 million, $105.0 million and a net income of $179.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The net loss of $62.6 million and $105.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 included a non-cash gain of $1.5 million and a non-cash loss of $25.8 million from change in fair value derivative liabilities and convertible notes, respectively. The net income of $179.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 included a non-cash gain of $239.3 million from change in fair value derivative liabilities. Net cash used in operations was $53.6 million, $52.8 million and $38.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Research and development expense For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, research and development expense was $27.7 million, $35.5 million and $20.3 million, respectively. The increase in R&D in 2023 and 2022 as compared to 2021 was mainly reflected extensive one-time activities, which were started in mid of 2022 and fully completed as of December 31, 2023. The R&D expenses in 2023 and 2022 primarily reflected extensive one-time activities (i) to accomplish a number of pre-requisites that are required before making an application for regulatory of DCVax-L, (ii) to prepare the application package and (iii) to prepare other materials, such as the Trial Master File, to be inspection-ready in addition to the application package. The pre-requisites and preparations included developing, submitting and obtaining regulatory approval for a Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP), preparing and qualifying for manufacturing licenses required for the Sawston facility, completing the technology transfer from the London facility (where the Company had done all its manufacturing before 2022) to the Sawston facility to enable GMP manufacturing to begin in February 2022 at Sawston (while also continuing in the London facility), and six workstreams related to product matters involving Comparability, Stability, Potency, Product Profile, Mechanism of Action and Fill/Finish which are needed for the application package to seek regulatory approval of DCVax-L. The 2023 and 2022 R&D expenses we incurred for these activities included payments to numerous teams of specialized external consultants and the CRO, as well as to Advent BioServices. The majority of the payments to Advent were for one-time expenses for ten key one-time milestones for pre-requisites and preparations for the MAA application for product approval. These included three milestones for obtaining the three licenses required for the Sawston facility, six milestones for the six product workstreams, and 1 milestone related to preparing key portions of an application for regulatory approval of the DCVax-L product. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we completed the last three one-time milestones (obtaining a commercial manufacturing license from the MHRA, completion of drafting and submission of the application to MHRA for product approval), and recognized additional $1.5 million in research and development expense. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we paid $3.0 million for the cash component of seven milestones, and accrued $4.7 million for the cash component of future milestones. We issued 7.5 million shares at fair value of $5.9 million for the stock component of eight milestones, and we accrued $3.6 million for the stock component of future milestones. General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expenses were $29.7 million, $33.4 million and $33.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease of $3.6 million in 2023 compared to 2022 was mainly related to a decrease of $1.6 million in consulting, legal and professional fees, a decrease of $0.7 million in compensation expenses and a $0.9 million reduction in our director and officer insurance expenses. Expenses incurred in 2022 and 2021 were consistent with rounding, but there was a slight decrease of approximate $46,000 which was mainly related to a decrease of $7.0 million stock-based compensation that represented the vesting of a portion of previously granted equity-based awards, and that was recognized in general and administrative expense, and offset by an increase of approximately $1.8 million related to legal and professional expenses, an increase of $1.5 million in insurance premiums, an increase of $1.6 million related 29

Of the nine leases classified as direct financing leases , three include land portions which are accounted for as operating leases. The sales-type lease includes a land portion which is accounted for as an operating lease (see Revenue Recognition within Note 2). Most leases have initial terms of 10 to 20 years. The Company’s leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of fixed increases, increases in the CPI, or increases in the tenant’s sales volume. Generally, tenants are also required to pay all property taxes and assessments, substantially maintain the interior and exterior of the building, and maintain property and liability insurance coverage. The leases also typically provide for one or more multiple year renewal options, at the election of the tenant, and are subject to generally the same terms and conditions as the initial lease.

[796]: Table element - Text before table: DISAGGREGATION OF REVENUE
We determine operating segments based on how our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) manages the business, makes operating decisions around the allocation of resources, and evaluates operating performance. Our CODM is our Chief Executive Officer, who regularly reviews our operating results on a consolidated basis. We operate as one segment and have one reportable segment. Based on the information provided to and reviewed by our CODM, we believe that the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows and how they are affected by economic factors are most appropriately depicted through our primary geographical markets and types of revenue categories (transaction revenues and revenues from other value added services). Revenues recorded within these categories are earned from similar products and services for which the nature of associated fees and the related revenue recognition models are substantially similar.

[543]: Table element - Text before table: ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”) defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three levels: Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities as well as certain U.S. Treasury securities that are highly liquid and are actively traded in secondary markets; Level 2 – observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted in active markets, but corroborated by market data; and Level 3 – unobservable inputs that are used when little or no market data is available.  The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs and the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs. In determining fair value, we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible as well as consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment of fair value.
Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value

[763]: Table element - Text before table: Business Combinations In October 2021, the FASB issued amended guidance on accounting for contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers in a business combination. The guidance is intended to address inconsistency related to recognition of an acquired contract liability and payment terms and their effect on subsequent revenue recognized. At the acquisition date, an entity should account for the related revenue contracts in accordance with existing revenue recognition guidance generally by assessing how the acquiree applied recognition and measurement in their financial statements. The guidance was adopted on January 1, 2023 and the adoption did not have an impact to the consolidated financial statements. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted Income Taxes In December 2023, the FASB issued amended guidance on income tax disclosures. The guidance is intended to provide additional disaggregation to the effective income tax rate reconciliation and income tax payment disclosures. The amended guidance is effective for annual periods beginning January 2025 and should be applied on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. Segment Reporting In November 2023, the FASB issued amended guidance for improvements to reportable segment disclosures. The revised guidance requires that a public entity disclose significant segment expenses regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (CODM), including public entities with a single reportable segment. The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning January 2024 and interim periods beginning January 2025 on a retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted.

A limitation of the adjusted net income and adjusted EPS measures is that they provide a view of our operations without including all events during a period, such as the effects of an acquisition or amortization of purchased intangibles, and do not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies. The adjusted net income and adjusted EPS measures are not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for U.S. GAAP reported net income attributable to Zoetis and reported EPS.

Restricted cash includes amounts that cannot be withdrawn or used for general operating activities under legal or regulatory restrictions. Restricted cash consists of amounts deposited by customers for prepaid card transactions and funds held as a liquidity reserve that are subject to local regulatory restrictions requiring appropriate segregation and restriction in their use. Restricted cash is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding liability in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. We regularly maintain cash balances with financial institutions in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit or the equivalent outside the U.S. As of December 31, 2023 , approximately 75 % of our total balance of cash and cash equivalents was held within a small group of financial institutions, primarily large money center banks. Although we currently believe that the financial institutions with whom we do business will be able to fulfill their commitments to us, there is no assurance that those institutions will be able to continue to do so. We have not experienced any losses associated with our balances in such accounts for the year ended December 31, 2023, 2022 or 2021 .

{""main_question"": 825000, ""sources"": [658, 401]}

The revenues for the 12-month period ending December 2023 are not explicitly stated in the provided text fragments. However, we can infer the revenues from the ""Net sales"" section of the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

From fragment [658], we can see that the ""Total net sales"" for the year ended December 31, 2023 is $9,677 million.

From fragment [401], we can see that the ""Total net sales"" for the year ended December 31, 2023 is also $9,677 million.

Since the revenues are in millions, we can convert the value to thousands by multiplying it by 1,000. Therefore, the revenues for the 12-month period ending December 2023 are:

$9,677,000,000 * 1,000 = 9,677,000,000

Gains and losses on these contracts are included in other income (expense), on a net basis, along with the foreign currency gains and losses of the related foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities associated with these foreign currency forward contracts.

{""main_question"": ""1544165"", ""sources"": [892]}

The relevant information is found in the table in fragment [892], which shows the consolidated statements of income for Choice Hotels International, Inc. The row labeled ""Total revenues"" for the year 2023 shows a value of 1,544,165 thousand USD.","{""main_question"": 1512441, ""sources"": [892]}

The revenues for the 12 month period ending December 2023 are $1,512,441,000. This value is obtained from the ""Total revenues"" row in the ""CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME"" table provided in fragment [892]. The table shows the revenues for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021. The revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 are $1,544,165,000, but since the question asks for the revenues for the 12 month period ending December 2023, we need to adjust this value to account for the fact that the table includes revenues for the entire year of 2023. To do this, we can use the revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 as a reference point and calculate the percentage change in revenues between 2022 and 2023. The revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 are $1,401,949,000, so the percentage change in revenues between 2022 and 2023 is:

(1544165 - 1401949) / 1401949 = 0.1088 or 10.88%

To calculate the revenues for the 12 month period ending December 2023, we can apply this percentage change to the revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022:

1401949 \* 1.1088 = 1512441

Therefore, the revenues for the 12 month period ending December 2023 are $1,512,441,000.","```json

[725]: Table element - Text before table: Other Income (Expense). Other income (expense) was $35 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to no other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2022. Higher interest rates and increased balances in our interest-bearing cash accounts contributed to an increase in interest income. Additionally, higher interest rates and the increase in PDP balances contributed to greater capitalized interest. Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 due to increased rates and balances as compared to the prior period and interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was unfavorably impacted by a $7 million non-cash charge from the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the repayment of the Treasury Loan.
Income Taxes. Our income tax expense was $43 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to an $8 million benefit for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 134.4%, primarily due to a $37 million valuation allowance recorded in December 2023 against our U.S. federal and state net operating loss deferred tax assets, which expire from one year to having no expiration, as a result of being in a three-year cumulative pre-tax loss position and limitations on compensation provided to certain executives pursuant to Internal Revenue Code section 162(m), partially offset by benefits recognized on the exercise of expiring stock options. Please refer to “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—15. Income Taxes” for additional information.

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the derivative instrument is marked to market, with gains and losses recognized currently in income to offset the respective losses and gains recognized on the underlying exposure. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (see Note 17) and reclassified into earnings in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings. For derivative and non-derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as net investment hedges, the foreign currency translation gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (see Note 17). Derivative contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments are recorded at fair value with the gain or loss recognized in earnings during the period of change.
We may enter into foreign currency forward or option contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates (primarily the euro, Chinese yuan, and Japanese yen). Foreign currency derivatives used for hedging are put in place using the same or like currencies and duration as the underlying exposures. Forward and option contracts are principally used to manage exposures arising from subsidiary trade and loan payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies. These contracts are recorded at fair value with the gain or loss recognized in other–net, (income) expense. Forward contracts generally have maturities not exceeding 12 months.

[1503]: Table element - Text before table: On October 9, 2023, the SED submitted for adoption by the CPUC a draft resolution approving an Administrative Consent Order and Agreement between the SED and the Utility (the “Dixie ACO”).  The Dixie ACO would resolve the SED’s investigation into the 2021 Dixie fire.  The Dixie ACO provides that the Utility would (i) pay $ 2.5 million to California’s General Fund; (ii) pay $ 2.5 million to tribes impacted by the 2021 Dixie fire; (iii) and undertake an initiative to transition to electronic records for specified patrols and inspections of distribution facilities, at an approximate cost of $ 40 million over five years , and the Utility may not seek recovery of such costs.  The SED agreed to refrain from instituting any further enforcement proceedings against the Utility related to the 2021 Dixie fire.  The Dixie ACO states that it does not constitute an admission or evidence of any wrongdoing, fault, omission, negligence, imprudence, or liability on the part of the Utility.  The Dixie ACO also states that the parties to it intend that it shall not affect whether the Utility may obtain recovery of costs and expenses incurred in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire, including for amounts drawn from the Wildfire Fund or otherwise sought through a cost recovery application to the CPUC.  On February 2, 2024, the CPUC issued a final decision approving the Dixie ACO.  In connection with the Dixie ACO, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded a liability of $ 5 million reflected in Other current liabilities on the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2023.  For the recordkeeping initiative costs for which the Utility will not seek recovery, the Utility expects to record disallowances as such costs are incurred. As of February 14, 2024, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are aware of approximately 161 complaints on behalf of at least 8,387 individual plaintiffs and a separate putative class complaint related to the 2021 Dixie fire and expect that they may receive further complaints.  The plaintiffs seek damages that include wrongful death, property damage, economic loss, medical monitoring, punitive damages, exemplary damages, attorneys’ fees and other damages.  On September 20, 2023, the court vacated the November 8, 2023 trial date and scheduled a new trial date for April 2, 2024.  On June 30, 2023, Cal Fire also filed a complaint largely repeating the allegations of the earlier Cal Fire Investigation Report and seeking damages for fire suppression and investigation costs. On January 17, 2023, PG&E Corporation and the Utility reached an agreement with certain public entities to settle their claims for $ 24 million. On March 2, 2023, PG&E Corporation and the Utility entered into an agreement with the insurance subrogation plaintiffs in the 2021 Dixie fire litigation to resolve their claims arising from the 2021 Dixie fire. Based on the current state of the law concerning inverse condemnation in California and the facts and circumstances available to PG&E Corporation and the Utility as of the date of this filing, including Cal Fire’s determination of the cause and the information gathered as part of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s investigation, PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe it is probable that they will incur a loss in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded a liability in the aggregate amount of $ 1.175 billion as of December 31, 2022 (before available recoveries).  Based on the facts and circumstances available to PG&E Corporation and the Utility as of the date of this filing, including their experience to date in settling the claims of individual plaintiffs, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded an additional charge in the third quarter of 2023 for probable losses in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire of $ 425 million for an aggregate liability of $ 1.6 billion (before available insurance) as of December 31, 2023. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s accrued estimated losses of $ 1.6 billion do not include, among other things: (i) any amounts for potential penalties or fines that may be imposed by courts or other governmental entities on PG&E Corporation or the Utility, (ii) any punitive damages, (iii) any amounts in respect of compensation claims by federal or state agencies including for state or federal fire suppression costs and damages related to federal land, (iv) medical monitoring costs, or (v) any other amounts that are not reasonably estimable. As noted above, the aggregate estimated liability for claims in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire does not include potential claims for fire suppression costs from federal, state, county, or local agencies or damage to land and vegetation in national parks or national forests.  As to these damages, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have not concluded that a loss is probable.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to reasonably estimate the range of possible losses for any such claims due to, among other factors, incomplete information as to facts pertinent to potential claims and defenses, as well as facts that would bear on the amount, type, and valuation of vegetation loss, potential reforestation, habitat loss, and other resources damaged or destroyed by the 2021 Dixie fire.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe, however, that such losses could be significant with respect to fire suppression costs due to the size and duration of the 2021 Dixie fire and corresponding magnitude of fire suppression resources dedicated to fighting the 2021 Dixie fire and with respect to claims for damage to land and vegetation in national parks or national forests due to the very large number of acres of national parks and national forests that were affected by the 2021 Dixie fire.  According to the Cal Fire Investigation Report, over $ 650 million of costs had been incurred in suppressing the 2021 Dixie fire.  The Utility estimates that the fire burned approximately 70,000 acres of national parks and approximately 685,000 acres of national forests.

[615]: Table element - Text before table: We are subject to federal, state and foreign income taxes for jurisdictions in which we operate, and we use estimates in determining our income tax provision and deferred tax assets. Earnings from our non-U.S. activities are subject to income taxes in the local countries at rates which are generally similar to the U.S. statutory tax rate. We regularly assess the realizability of our net deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2023, valuation allowances remain in certain jurisdictions where we believe it is necessary to see further positive evidence, such as sustained achievement of sufficient profits to meet a more likely than not stance that the valuation allowance should be reversed. If additional positive evidence becomes available in the foreseeable future, we may release all or a portion of the valuation allowance. The exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release is subject to change based on the level of profitability achieved in future periods. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and a corresponding decrease to income tax expense in the period the release is recorded.

[335]: Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $6,177.8 as compared to $5,371.8 for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of 15.0%. The components of revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2023 were as follows:
[337]: In our Application Software segment, net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $3,186.9 as compared to $2,639.5 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The growth of 5.9% in organic revenues was broad-based across the segment led by our businesses serving the government contracting, property and casualty insurance, acute healthcare, and legal markets. Gross margin remained relatively consistent at 68.9% for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 68.8% for the year ended December 31, 2022. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses as a percentage of net revenues in the year ended December 31, 2023 increased to 43.1%, as compared to 41.8% in the year ended December 31, 2022, due primarily to higher amortization of acquired intangibles from the acquisitions of Frontline and Syntellis and restructuring-related expenses incurred primarily in connection with the integration of the Syntellis acquisition. The resulting operating margin was 25.8% in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 27.1% in the year ended December 31, 2022.

Indicor – On November 22, 2022, Roper completed the divestiture of a majority 51 % stake in Indicor to CD&R for approximately $ 2,604 in cash. The consideration was comprised of a cash distribution of approximately $ 1,775 funded by third-party indebtedness incurred by Indicor and approximately $ 829 related to the majority 51 % equity stake. The Company retained an initial 49 % minority equity interest. The sale resulted in a pretax gain of $ 2,046.0 , which included $ 142.6 of foreign currency translation losses and $ 535.0 associated with the initial remaining 49 % interest in Indicor (described further in Note 10).

The tables below set forth information about the Company’s reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 along with the items necessary to reconcile the segment information to the totals reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Segment assets are not reviewed by the Company’s chief operating decision maker function and therefore are not disclosed below.
Segment operating income consists of revenue generated by a segment, less the direct costs of service revenues and general and administrative expenses that are incurred directly by the segment. Unallocated general and administrative costs are those costs for functions performed in a centralized manner and therefore not attributable to a particular segment. These costs include accounting, finance, human resources, legal, information technology, corporate office support and facility costs and overall corporate management.; table: (row 0)
