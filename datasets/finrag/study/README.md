# finRAG Study
The finRAG study is looking at a subset of 50 filings chosen from the 1116 reports.
We believe this number is sufficient to yield statistically significant results as each filing has 3 sub-datasets and 6 questions each, so a total of 900 rows.
We encourage further research to be done with the dataset and as all the materials are open sourced, checking this hypothesis is open for anyone to explore.
